mail

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

mail — Send mail

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool mail ( string $to , string $subject , string $message [, string~
    $additional_headers [, string $additional_parameters ]] )~

Sends an email.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{to}

    Receiver, or receivers of the mail.

    The formatting of this string must comply with >> RFC 2822. Some examples
    are:
      + user@example.com
      + user@example.com, anotheruser@example.com
      + User <user@example.com>
      + User <user@example.com>, Another User <anotheruser@example.com>

{subject}

    Subject of the email to be sent.

    Caution

    Subject must satisfy >> RFC 2047.

{message}

    Message to be sent.

    Each line should be separated with a CRLF (\r\n). Lines should not be
    larger than 70 characters.

    Caution

    (Windows only) When PHP is talking to a SMTP server directly, if a full
    stop is found on the start of a line, it is removed. To counter-act this,
    replace these occurrences with a double dot.
    <?php >
    $text = str_replace("\n.", "\n..", $text);
<    ?>

{additional_headers} (optional)

    String to be inserted at the end of the email header.

    This is typically used to add extra headers (From, Cc, and Bcc). Multiple
    extra headers should be separated with a CRLF (\r\n). If outside data are
    used to compose this header, the data should be sanitized so that no
    unwanted headers could be injected.

        Note:

        {additional_headers} does not have mail header injection protection.
        Therefore, users must make sure specified headers are safe and
        contains headers only. i.e. Never start mail body by putting multiple
        newlines.

        Note:

        When sending mail, the mail must contain a From header. This can be
        set with the {additional_headers} parameter, or a default can be set
        in php.ini.

        Failing to do this will result in an error message similar to Warning:
        mail(): "sendmail_from" not set in php.ini or custom "From:" header
        missing. The From header sets also Return-Path under Windows.

        Note:

        If messages are not received, try using a LF (\n) only. Some Unix mail
        transfer agents (most notably >> qmail) replace LF by CRLF
        automatically (which leads to doubling CR if CRLF is used). This
        should be a last resort, as it does not comply with >> RFC 2822.

{additional_parameters} (optional)

    The {additional_parameters} parameter can be used to pass additional flags
    as command line options to the program configured to be used when sending
    mail, as defined by the sendmail_path configuration setting. For example,
    this can be used to set the envelope sender address when using sendmail
    with the -f sendmail option.

    This parameter is escaped by |escapeshellcmd| internally to prevent
    command execution. |escapeshellcmd| prevents command execution, but allows
    to add additional parameters. For security reasons, it is recommended for
    the user to sanitize this parameter to avoid adding unwanted parameters to
    the shell command.

    Since |escapeshellcmd| is applied automatically, some characters that are
    allowed as email addresses by internet RFCs cannot be used. mail() can not
    allow such characters, so in programs where the use of such characters is
    required, alternative means of sending emails (such as using a framework
    or a library) is recommended.

    The user that the webserver runs as should be added as a trusted user to
    the sendmail configuration to prevent a 'X-Warning' header from being
    added to the message when the envelope sender (-f) is set using this
    method. For sendmail users, this file is /etc/mail/trusted-users.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE if the mail was successfully accepted for delivery, FALSE
otherwise.

It is important to note that just because the mail was accepted for delivery,
it does NOT mean the mail will actually reach the intended destination.

==============================================================================
*Changelog*

Version                              Description
        The {additional_parameters} parameter is disabled in safe_mode and the
4.2.3   mail() function will expose a warning message and return FALSE when
        used.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 Sending mail.

Using mail() to send a simple email:

<?php >
    // The message
    $message = "Line 1\r\nLine 2\r\nLine 3";

    //
     In case any of our lines are larger than 70 characters, we should use wordwrap
    ()
    $message = wordwrap($message, 70, "\r\n");

    // Send
    mail('caffeinated@example.com', 'My Subject', $message);
<?>

Example #2 Sending mail with extra headers.

The addition of basic headers, telling the MUA the From and Reply-To
addresses:

<?php >
    $to      = 'nobody@example.com';
    $subject = 'the subject';
    $message = 'hello';
    $headers = 'From: webmaster@example.com' . "\r\n" .
        'Reply-To: webmaster@example.com' . "\r\n" .
        'X-Mailer: PHP/' . phpversion();

    mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers);
<?>

Example #3 Sending mail with an additional command line parameter.

The {additional_parameters} parameter can be used to pass an additional
parameter to the program configured to use when sending mail using the
sendmail_path.

<?php >
    mail('nobody@example.com', 'the subject', 'the message', null,
       '-fwebmaster@example.com');
<?>

Example #4 Sending HTML email

It is also possible to send HTML email with mail().

<?php >
    // Multiple recipients
    $to = 'johny@example.com, sally@example.com'; // note the comma

    // Subject
    $subject = 'Birthday Reminders for August';

    // Message
    $message = '
    <html>
    <head>
      <title>Birthday Reminders for August</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <p>Here are the birthdays upcoming in August!</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Person</th><th>Day</th><th>Month</th><th>Year</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Johny</td><td>10th</td><td>August</td><td>1970</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Sally</td><td>17th</td><td>August</td><td>1973</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </body>
    </html>
    ';

    // To send HTML mail, the Content-type header must be set
    $headers[] = 'MIME-Version: 1.0';
    $headers[] = 'Content-type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1';

    // Additional headers
    $headers[] = 'To: Mary <mary@example.com>, Kelly <kelly@example.com>';
    $headers[] = 'From: Birthday Reminder <birthday@example.com>';
    $headers[] = 'Cc: birthdayarchive@example.com';
    $headers[] = 'Bcc: birthdaycheck@example.com';

    // Mail it
    mail($to, $subject, $message, implode("\r\n", $headers));
<?>

    Note:

    If intending to send HTML or otherwise Complex mails, it is recommended to
    use the PEAR package >> PEAR::Mail_Mime.

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    The Windows implementation of mail() differs in many ways from the Unix
    implementation. First, it doesn't use a local binary for composing
    messages but only operates on direct sockets which means a MTA is needed
    listening on a network socket (which can either on the localhost or a
    remote machine).

    Second, the custom headers like From:, Cc:, Bcc: and Date: are not
    interpreted by the MTA in the first place, but are parsed by PHP.

    As such, the {to} parameter should not be an address in the form of
    "Something <someone@example.com>". The mail command may not parse this
    properly while talking with the MTA.

    Note:

    It is worth noting that the mail() function is not suitable for larger
    volumes of email in a loop. This function opens and closes an SMTP socket
    for each email, which is not very efficient.

    For the sending of large amounts of email, see the >> PEAR::Mail, and >>
     PEAR::Mail_Queue packages.

    Note:

    The following RFCs may be useful: >> RFC 1896, >> RFC 2045, >> RFC 2046,
    >> RFC 2047, >> RFC 2048, >> RFC 2049, and >> RFC 2822.
