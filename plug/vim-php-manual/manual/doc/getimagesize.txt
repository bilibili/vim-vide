getimagesize

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

getimagesize — Get the size of an image

==============================================================================
*Description*

    array getimagesize ( string $filename [, array &$imageinfo ] )~

The getimagesize() function will determine the size of any supported given
image file and return the dimensions along with the file type and a height/
width text string to be used inside a normal HTML IMG tag and the
correspondent HTTP content type.

getimagesize() can also return some more information in {imageinfo} parameter.

    Note: Note that JPC and JP2 are capable of having components with
    different bit depths. In this case, the value for "bits" is the highest
    bit depth encountered. Also, JP2 files may contain multiple JPEG 2000
    codestreams. In this case, getimagesize() returns the values for the first
    codestream it encounters in the root of the file.

    Note: The information about icons are retrieved from the icon with the
    highest bitrate.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{filename}

    This parameter specifies the file you wish to retrieve information about.
    It can reference a local file or (configuration permitting) a remote file
    using one of the supported streams.

{imageinfo}

    This optional parameter allows you to extract some extended information
    from the image file. Currently, this will return the different JPG APP
    markers as an associative array. Some programs use these APP markers to
    embed text information in images. A very common one is to embed >> IPTC
    information in the APP13 marker. You can use the |iptcparse| function to
    parse the binary APP13 marker into something readable.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns an array with up to 7 elements. Not all image types will include the
channels and bits elements.

Index 0 and 1 contains respectively the width and the height of the image.

    Note:

    Some formats may contain no image or may contain multiple images. In these
    cases, getimagesize() might not be able to properly determine the image
    size. getimagesize() will return zero for width and height in these cases.

Index 2 is one of the IMAGETYPE_XXX constants indicating the type of the
image.

Index 3 is a text string with the correct height="yyy" width="xxx" string that
can be used directly in an IMG tag.

mime is the correspondant MIME type of the image. This information can be used
to deliver images with the correct HTTP Content-type header:

Example #1 getimagesize() and MIME types

<?php >
    $size = getimagesize($filename);
    $fp = fopen($filename, "rb");
    if ($size && $fp) {
        header("Content-type: {$size['mime']}");
        fpassthru($fp);
        exit;
    } else {
        // error
    }
<?>

channels will be 3 for RGB pictures and 4 for CMYK pictures.

bits is the number of bits for each color.

For some image types, the presence of channels and bits values can be a bit
confusing. As an example, GIF always uses 3 channels per pixel, but the number
of bits per pixel cannot be calculated for an animated GIF with a global color
table.

On failure, FALSE is returned.

==============================================================================
*Errors/Exceptions*

If accessing the {filename} image is impossible getimagesize() will generate
an error of level E_WARNING. On read error, getimagesize() will generate an
error of level E_NOTICE.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #2 getimagesize() example

<?php >
    list($width, $height, $type, $attr) = getimagesize("img/flag.jpg");
    echo "<img src=\"img/flag.jpg\" $attr alt=\"getimagesize() example\" />";
<?>

Example #3 getimagesize (URL)

<?php >
    $size = getimagesize("http://www.example.com/gifs/logo.gif");

    // if the file name has space in it, encode it properly
    $size = getimagesize("http://www.example.com/gifs/lo%20go.gif");

<?>

Example #4 getimagesize() returning IPTC

<?php >
    $size = getimagesize("testimg.jpg", $info);
    if (isset($info["APP13"])) {
        $iptc = iptcparse($info["APP13"]);
        var_dump($iptc);
    }
<?>

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    This function does not require the GD image library.

    Note:

    This function expects {filename} to be a valid image file. If a non-image
    file is supplied, it may be incorrectly detected as an image and the
    function will return successfully.

    Do not use getimagesize() to check that a given file is a valid image. Use
    a purpose-built solution such as the Fileinfo extension instead.
