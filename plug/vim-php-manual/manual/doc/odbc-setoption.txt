odbc_setoption — Adjust ODBC settings

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool odbc_setoption ( resource $id , int $function , int $option , int~
    $param )~

This function allows fiddling with the ODBC options for a particular
connection or query result. It was written to help find work around to
problems in quirky ODBC drivers. You should probably only use this function if
you are an ODBC programmer and understand the effects the various options will
have. You will certainly need a good ODBC reference to explain all the
different options and values that can be used. Different driver versions
support different options.

Because the effects may vary depending on the ODBC driver, use of this
function in scripts to be made publicly available is strongly discouraged.
Also, some ODBC options are not available to this function because they must
be set before the connection is established or the query is prepared. However,
if on a particular job it can make PHP work so your boss doesn't tell you to
use a commercial product, that's all that really matters.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{id}

    Is a connection id or result id on which to change the settings. For
    SQLSetConnectOption(), this is a connection id. For SQLSetStmtOption(),
    this is a result id.

{function}

    Is the ODBC function to use. The value should be 1 for SQLSetConnectOption
    () and 2 for SQLSetStmtOption().

{option}

    The option to set.

{param}

    The value for the given {option}.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 odbc_setoption() examples

<?php >
    // 1. Option 102 of SQLSetConnectOption() is SQL_AUTOCOMMIT.
    //    Value 1 of SQL_AUTOCOMMIT is SQL_AUTOCOMMIT_ON.
    //    This example has the same effect as
    //    odbc_autocommit($conn, true);

    odbc_setoption($conn, 1, 102, 1);

    // 2. Option 0 of SQLSetStmtOption() is SQL_QUERY_TIMEOUT.
    //    This example sets the query to timeout after 30 seconds.

    $result = odbc_prepare($conn, $sql);
    odbc_setoption($result, 2, 0, 30);
    odbc_execute($result);
