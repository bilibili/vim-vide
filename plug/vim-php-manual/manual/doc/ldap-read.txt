ldap_read — Read an entry

==============================================================================
*Description*

    resource ldap_read ( resource $link_identifier , string $base_dn , string~
    $filter [, array $attributes [, int $attrsonly [, int $sizelimit [, int~
    $timelimit [, int $deref ]]]]] )~

Performs the search for a specified {filter} on the directory with the scope
LDAP_SCOPE_BASE. So it is equivalent to reading an entry from the directory.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{link_identifier}

    An LDAP link identifier, returned by |ldap_connect|.

{base_dn}

    The base DN for the directory.

{filter}

    An empty filter is not allowed. If you want to retrieve absolutely all
    information for this entry, use a filter of objectClass=*. If you know
    which entry types are used on the directory server, you might use an
    appropriate filter such as objectClass=inetOrgPerson.

{attributes}

    An array of the required attributes, e.g. array("mail", "sn", "cn"). Note
    that the "dn" is always returned irrespective of which attributes types
    are requested.

    Using this parameter is much more efficient than the default action (which
    is to return all attributes and their associated values). The use of this
    parameter should therefore be considered good practice.

{attrsonly}

    Should be set to 1 if only attribute types are wanted. If set to 0 both
    attributes types and attribute values are fetched which is the default
    behaviour.

{sizelimit}

    Enables you to limit the count of entries fetched. Setting this to 0 means
    no limit.

        Note:

        This parameter can NOT override server-side preset sizelimit. You can
        set it lower though.

        Some directory server hosts will be configured to return no more than
        a preset number of entries. If this occurs, the server will indicate
        that it has only returned a partial results set. This also occurs if
        you use this parameter to limit the count of fetched entries.

{timelimit}

    Sets the number of seconds how long is spend on the search. Setting this
    to 0 means no limit.

        Note:

        This parameter can NOT override server-side preset timelimit. You can
        set it lower though.

{deref}

    Specifies how aliases should be handled during the search. It can be one
    of the following:
      + LDAP_DEREF_NEVER - (default) aliases are never dereferenced.
      + LDAP_DEREF_SEARCHING - aliases should be dereferenced during the
        search but not when locating the base object of the search.
      + LDAP_DEREF_FINDING - aliases should be dereferenced when locating the
        base object but not during the search.
      + LDAP_DEREF_ALWAYS - aliases should be dereferenced always.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns a search result identifier or FALSE on error.
