imap_getsubscribed

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

imap_getsubscribed — List all the subscribed mailboxes

==============================================================================
*Description*

    array imap_getsubscribed ( resource $imap_stream , string $ref , string~
    $pattern )~

Gets information about the subscribed mailboxes.

Identical to |imap_getmailboxes|, except that it only returns mailboxes that
the user is subscribed to.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{ imap_stream}

    An IMAP stream returned by |imap_open|.

{ref}

    {ref} should normally be just the server specification as described in 
    |imap_open|

{pattern}

    Specifies where in the mailbox hierarchy to start searching.

    There are two special characters you can pass as part of the {pattern}: '*
    ' and '%'. '*' means to return all mailboxes. If you pass {pattern} as '*
    ', you will get a list of the entire mailbox hierarchy. '%' means to
    return the current level only. '%' as the {pattern} parameter will return
    only the top level mailboxes; '~/mail/%' on UW_IMAPD will return every
    mailbox in the ~/mail directory, but none in subfolders of that directory.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns an array of objects containing mailbox information. Each object has
the attributes {name}, specifying the full name of the mailbox; {delimiter},
which is the hierarchy delimiter for the part of the hierarchy this mailbox is
in; and {attributes}. {Attributes} is a bitmask that can be tested against:

  * LATT_NOINFERIORS - This mailbox has no "children" (there are no mailboxes
    below this one).
  * LATT_NOSELECT - This is only a container, not a mailbox - you cannot open
    it.
  * LATT_MARKED - This mailbox is marked. Only used by UW-IMAPD.
  * LATT_UNMARKED - This mailbox is not marked. Only used by UW-IMAPD.
