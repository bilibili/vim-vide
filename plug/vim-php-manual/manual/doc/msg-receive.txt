msg_receive

(PHP 4 >= 4.3.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

msg_receive — Receive a message from a message queue

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool msg_receive ( resource $queue , int $desiredmsgtype , int &$msgtype~
    , int $maxsize , mixed &$message [, bool $unserialize = true [, int~
    $flags = 0 [, int &$errorcode ]]] )~

msg_receive() will receive the first message from the specified {queue} of the
type specified by {desiredmsgtype}.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{queue}

{desiredmsgtype}

    If {desiredmsgtype} is 0, the message from the front of the queue is
    returned. If {desiredmsgtype} is greater than 0, then the first message of
    that type is returned. If {desiredmsgtype} is less than 0, the first
    message on the queue with the lowest type less than or equal to the
    absolute value of {desiredmsgtype} will be read. If no messages match the
    criteria, your script will wait until a suitable message arrives on the
    queue. You can prevent the script from blocking by specifying
    MSG_IPC_NOWAIT in the {flags} parameter.

{msgtype}

    The type of the message that was received will be stored in this
    parameter.

{maxsize}

    The maximum size of message to be accepted is specified by the {maxsize};
    if the message in the queue is larger than this size the function will
    fail (unless you set {flags} as described below).

{message}

    The received message will be stored in {message}, unless there were errors
    receiving the message.

{unserialize}

    If set to TRUE, the message is treated as though it was serialized using
    the same mechanism as the session module. The message will be unserialized
    and then returned to your script. This allows you to easily receive arrays
    or complex object structures from other PHP scripts, or if you are using
    the WDDX serializer, from any WDDX compatible source.

    If {unserialize} is FALSE, the message will be returned as a binary-safe
    string.

{flags}

    The optional {flags} allows you to pass flags to the low-level msgrcv
    system call. It defaults to 0, but you may specify one or more of the
    following values (by adding or ORing them together).

                         Flag values for msg_receive
                   If there are no messages of the {desiredmsgtype}, return
    MSG_IPC_NOWAIT immediately and do not wait. The function will fail and
                   return an integer value corresponding to MSG_ENOMSG.
                   Using this flag in combination with a {desiredmsgtype}
    MSG_EXCEPT     greater than 0 will cause the function to receive the first
                   message that is not equal to {desiredmsgtype}.
                   If the message is longer than {maxsize}, setting this flag
    MSG_NOERROR    will truncate the message to {maxsize} and will not signal
                   an error.

{errorcode}

    If the function fails, the optional {errorcode} will be set to the value
    of the system errno variable.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

Upon successful completion the message queue data structure is updated as
follows: msg_lrpid is set to the process-ID of the calling process, msg_qnum
is decremented by 1 and msg_rtime is set to the current time.
