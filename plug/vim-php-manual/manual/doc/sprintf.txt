sprintf

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

sprintf — Return a formatted string

==============================================================================
*Description*

    string sprintf ( string $format [, mixed $args [, mixed $... ]] )~

Returns a string produced according to the formatting string {format}.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{format}

    The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary
    characters (excluding %) that are copied directly to the result, and
    conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching its own
    parameter. This applies to both sprintf() and |printf|.

    Each conversion specification consists of a percent sign (%), followed by
    one or more of these elements, in order:
     1. An optional sign specifier that forces a sign (- or +) to be used on a
        number. By default, only the - sign is used on a number if it's
        negative. This specifier forces positive numbers to have the + sign
        attached as well.
     2. An optional padding specifier that says what character will be used
        for padding the results to the right string size. This may be a space
        character or a 0 (zero character). The default is to pad with spaces.
        An alternate padding character can be specified by prefixing it with a
        single quote ('). See the examples below.
     3. An optional alignment specifier that says if the result should be
        left-justified or right-justified. The default is right-justified; a -
        character here will make it left-justified.
     4. An optional number, a width specifier that says how many characters
        (minimum) this conversion should result in.
     5. An optional precision specifier in the form of a period (.) followed
        by an optional decimal digit string that says how many decimal digits
        should be displayed for floating-point numbers. When using this
        specifier on a string, it acts as a cutoff point, setting a maximum
        character limit to the string. Additionally, the character to use when
        padding a number may optionally be specified between the period and
        the digit.
     6. A type specifier that says what type the argument data should be
        treated as. Possible types:
          o % - a literal percent character. No argument is required.
          o b - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as a
            binary number.
          o c - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as the
            character with that ASCII value.
          o d - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as a
            (signed) decimal number.
          o e - the argument is treated as scientific notation (e.g. 1.2e+2).
            The precision specifier stands for the number of digits after the
            decimal point since PHP 5.2.1. In earlier versions, it was taken
            as number of significant digits (one less).
          o E - like %e but uses uppercase letter (e.g. 1.2E+2).
          o f - the argument is treated as a float, and presented as a
            floating-point number (locale aware).
          o F - the argument is treated as a float, and presented as a
            floating-point number (non-locale aware). Available since PHP
            5.0.3.
          o g - shorter of %e and %f.
          o G - shorter of %E and %f.
          o o - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as an
            octal number.
          o s - the argument is treated as and presented as a string.
          o u - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as an
            unsigned decimal number.
          o x - the argument is treated as an integer and presented as a
            hexadecimal number (with lowercase letters).
          o X - the argument is treated as an integer and presented as a
            hexadecimal number (with uppercase letters).

    Variables will be co-erced to a suitable type for the specifier:

         Type Handling
     Type        Specifiers
    string  s
    integer d, u, c, o, x, X, b
    double  g, G, e, E, f, F

    Warning

    Attempting to use a combination of the string and width specifiers with
    character sets that require more than one byte per character may result in
    unexpected results

    The format string supports argument numbering/swapping. Here is an
    example:
   
    Example #1 Argument swapping

    <?php >
    $num = 5;
    $location = 'tree';

    $format = 'There are %d monkeys in the %s';
    echo sprintf($format, $num, $location);
<    ?>
    This will output "There are 5 monkeys in the tree". But imagine we are
    creating a format string in a separate file, commonly because we would
    like to internationalize it and we rewrite it as:
   
    Example #2 Argument swapping

    <?php >
    $format = 'The %s contains %d monkeys';
    echo sprintf($format, $num, $location);
<    ?>
    We now have a problem. The order of the placeholders in the format string
    does not match the order of the arguments in the code. We would like to
    leave the code as is and simply indicate in the format string which
    arguments the placeholders refer to. We would write the format string like
    this instead:
   
    Example #3 Argument swapping

    <?php >
    $format = 'The %2$s contains %1$d monkeys';
    echo sprintf($format, $num, $location);
<    ?>
    An added benefit here is that you can repeat the placeholders without
    adding more arguments in the code. For example:
   
    Example #4 Argument swapping

    <?php >
    $format = 'The %2$s contains %1$d monkeys.
               That\'s a nice %2$s full of %1$d monkeys.';
    echo sprintf($format, $num, $location);
<    ?>
    When using argument swapping, the n$ position specifier must come
    immediately after the percent sign (%), before any other specifiers, as
    shown in the example below.
   
    Example #5 Specifying padding character

    <?php >
    echo sprintf("%'.9d\n", 123);
    echo sprintf("%'.09d\n", 123);
<    ?>

    The above example will output:

    ......123
    000000123

    Example #6 Position specifier with other specifiers

    <?php >
    $format = 'The %2$s contains %1$04d monkeys';
    echo sprintf($format, $num, $location);
<    ?>

    The above example will output:

    The tree contains 0005 monkeys

        Note:

        Attempting to use a position specifier greater than PHP_INT_MAX will
        result in sprintf() generating warnings.

    Warning

    The c type specifier ignores padding and width

*Examples*

Example #7 |printf|: various examples

<?php >
    $n =  43951789;
    $u = -43951789;
    $c = 65; // ASCII 65 is 'A'

    // notice the double %%, this prints a literal '%' character
    printf("%%b = '%b'\n", $n); // binary representation
    printf("%%c = '%c'\n", $c); // print the ascii character, same as chr()
     function
    printf("%%d = '%d'\n", $n); // standard integer representation
    printf("%%e = '%e'\n", $n); // scientific notation
    printf("%%u = '%u'\n", $n); //
     unsigned integer representation of a positive integer
    printf("%%u = '%u'\n", $u); //
     unsigned integer representation of a negative integer
    printf("%%f = '%f'\n", $n); // floating point representation
    printf("%%o = '%o'\n", $n); // octal representation
    printf("%%s = '%s'\n", $n); // string representation
    printf("%%x = '%x'\n", $n); // hexadecimal representation (lower-case)
    printf("%%X = '%X'\n", $n); // hexadecimal representation (upper-case)

    printf("%%+d = '%+d'\n", $n); // sign specifier on a positive integer
    printf("%%+d = '%+d'\n", $u); // sign specifier on a negative integer
<?>

The above example will output:

%b = '10100111101010011010101101'
%c = 'A'
%d = '43951789'
%e = '4.39518e+7'
%u = '43951789'
%u = '4251015507'
%f = '43951789.000000'
%o = '247523255'
%s = '43951789'
%x = '29ea6ad'
%X = '29EA6AD'
%+d = '+43951789'
%+d = '-43951789'

Example #8 |printf|: string specifiers

<?php >
    $s = 'monkey';
    $t = 'many monkeys';

    printf("[%s]\n",      $s); // standard string output
    printf("[%10s]\n",    $s); // right-justification with spaces
    printf("[%-10s]\n",   $s); // left-justification with spaces
    printf("[%010s]\n",   $s); // zero-padding works on strings too
    printf("[%'#10s]\n",  $s); // use the custom padding character '#'
    printf("[%10.10s]\n", $t); //
     left-justification but with a cutoff of 10 characters
<?>

The above example will output:

[monkey]
[    monkey]
[monkey    ]
[0000monkey]
[####monkey]
[many monke]

Example #9 sprintf(): zero-padded integers

<?php >
    $isodate = sprintf("%04d-%02d-%02d", $year, $month, $day);
<?>

Example #10 sprintf(): formatting currency

<?php >
    $money1 = 68.75;
    $money2 = 54.35;
    $money = $money1 + $money2;
    // echo $money will output "123.1";
    $formatted = sprintf("%01.2f", $money);
    // echo $formatted will output "123.10"
<?>

Example #11 sprintf(): scientific notation

<?php >
    $number = 362525200;

    echo sprintf("%.3e", $number); // outputs 3.625e+8
<?>
