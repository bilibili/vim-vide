socket_recvfrom

(PHP 4 >= 4.1.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

socket_recvfrom — Receives data from a socket whether or not it is
connection-oriented

==============================================================================
*Description*

    int socket_recvfrom ( resource $socket , string &$buf , int $len , int~
    $flags , string &$name [, int &$port ] )~

The socket_recvfrom() function receives {len} bytes of data in {buf} from
{name} on port {port} (if the socket is not of type AF_UNIX) using {socket}. 
socket_recvfrom() can be used to gather data from both connected and
unconnected sockets. Additionally, one or more flags can be specified to
modify the behaviour of the function.

The {name} and {port} must be passed by reference. If the socket is not
connection-oriented, {name} will be set to the internet protocol address of
the remote host or the path to the UNIX socket. If the socket is
connection-oriented, {name} is NULL. Additionally, the {port} will contain the
port of the remote host in the case of an unconnected AF_INET or AF_INET6
socket.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{socket}

    The {socket} must be a socket resource previously created by socket_create
    ().

{buf}

    The data received will be fetched to the variable specified with {buf}.

{len}

    Up to {len} bytes will be fetched from remote host.

{flags}

    The value of {flags} can be any combination of the following flags, joined
    with the binary OR (|) operator.

                         Possible values for {flags}
        Flag                              Description
    MSG_OOB      Process out-of-band data.
    MSG_PEEK     Receive data from the beginning of the receive queue without
                 removing it from the queue.
                 Block until at least {len} are received. However, if a signal
    MSG_WAITALL  is caught or the remote host disconnects, the function may
                 return less data.
    MSG_DONTWAIT With this flag set, the function returns even if it would
                 normally have blocked.

{name}

    If the socket is of the type AF_UNIX type, {name} is the path to the file.
    Else, for unconnected sockets, {name} is the IP address of, the remote
    host, or NULL if the socket is connection-oriented.

{port}

    This argument only applies to AF_INET and AF_INET6 sockets, and specifies
    the remote port from which the data is received. If the socket is
    connection-oriented, {port} will be NULL.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

socket_recvfrom() returns the number of bytes received, or FALSE if there was
an error. The actual error code can be retrieved by calling |socket_last_error
|. This error code may be passed to |socket_strerror| to get a textual
explanation of the error.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 socket_recvfrom() example

<?php >
    error_reporting(E_ALL | E_STRICT);

    $socket = socket_create(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, SOL_UDP);
    socket_bind($socket, '127.0.0.1', 1223);

    $from = '';
    $port = 0;
    socket_recvfrom($socket, $buf, 12, 0, $from, $port);

    echo "Received $buf from remote address $from and remote port $port" . PHP_EOL
    ;
<?>

This example will initiate a UDP socket on port 1223 of 127.0.0.1 and print at
most 12 characters received from a remote host.

*Changelog*

Version              Description
4.3.0   socket_recvfrom() is now binary safe.
