socket_select

(PHP 4 >= 4.1.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

socket_select — Runs the select() system call on the given arrays of sockets
with a specified timeout

==============================================================================
*Description*

    int socket_select ( array &$read , array &$write , array &$except , int~
    $tv_sec [, int $tv_usec = 0 ] )~

socket_select() accepts arrays of sockets and waits for them to change status.
Those coming with BSD sockets background will recognize that those socket
resource arrays are in fact the so-called file descriptor sets. Three
independent arrays of socket resources are watched.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{read}

    The sockets listed in the {read} array will be watched to see if
    characters become available for reading (more precisely, to see if a read
    will not block - in particular, a socket resource is also ready on
    end-of-file, in which case a |socket_read| will return a zero length
    string).

{write}

    The sockets listed in the {write} array will be watched to see if a write
    will not block.

{except}

    The sockets listed in the {except} array will be watched for exceptions.

{tv_sec}

    The {tv_sec} and {tv_usec} together form the timeout parameter. The
    timeout is an upper bound on the amount of time elapsed before 
    socket_select() return. {tv_sec} may be zero , causing socket_select() to
    return immediately. This is useful for polling. If {tv_sec} is NULL (no
    timeout), socket_select() can block indefinitely.

{tv_usec}

Warning

On exit, the arrays are modified to indicate which socket resource actually
changed status.

You do not need to pass every array to socket_select(). You can leave it out
and use an empty array or NULL instead. Also do not forget that those arrays
are passed by reference and will be modified after socket_select() returns.

    Note:

    Due a limitation in the current Zend Engine it is not possible to pass a
    constant modifier like NULL directly as a parameter to a function which
    expects this parameter to be passed by reference. Instead use a temporary
    variable or an expression with the leftmost member being a temporary
    variable:
   
    Example #1 Using NULL with socket_select()

    <?php >
    $e = NULL;
    socket_select($r, $w, $e, 0);
<    ?>

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

On success socket_select() returns the number of socket resources contained in
the modified arrays, which may be zero if the timeout expires before anything
interesting happens. On error FALSE is returned. The error code can be
retrieved with |socket_last_error|.

    Note:

    Be sure to use the === operator when checking for an error. Since the 
    socket_select() may return 0 the comparison with == would evaluate to TRUE
    :
   
    Example #2 Understanding socket_select()'s result

    <?php >
    $e = NULL;
    if (false === socket_select($r, $w, $e, 0)) {
        echo "socket_select() failed, reason: " .
            socket_strerror(socket_last_error()) . "\n";
    }
<    ?>

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #3 socket_select() example

<?php >
    /* Prepare the read array */
    $read   = array($socket1, $socket2);
    $write  = NULL;
    $except = NULL;
    $num_changed_sockets = socket_select($read, $write, $except, 0);

    if ($num_changed_sockets === false) {
        /* Error handling */
    } else if ($num_changed_sockets > 0) {
        /* At least at one of the sockets something interesting happened */
    }
<?>

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    Be aware that some socket implementations need to be handled very
    carefully. A few basic rules:
      + You should always try to use socket_select() without timeout. Your
        program should have nothing to do if there is no data available. Code
        that depends on timeouts is not usually portable and difficult to
        debug.
      + No socket resource must be added to any set if you do not intend to
        check its result after the socket_select() call, and respond
        appropriately. After socket_select() returns, all socket resources in
        all arrays must be checked. Any socket resource that is available for
        writing must be written to, and any socket resource available for
        reading must be read from.
      + If you read/write to a socket returns in the arrays be aware that they
        do not necessarily read/write the full amount of data you have
        requested. Be prepared to even only be able to read/write a single
        byte.
      + It's common to most socket implementations that the only exception
        caught with the {except} array is out-of-bound data received on a
        socket.
