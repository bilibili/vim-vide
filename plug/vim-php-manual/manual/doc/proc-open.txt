proc_open

(PHP 4 >= 4.3.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

proc_open — Execute a command and open file pointers for input/output

==============================================================================
*Description*

    resource proc_open ( string $cmd , array $descriptorspec , array &$pipes~
    [, string $cwd [, array $env [, array $other_options ]]] )~

proc_open() is similar to |popen| but provides a much greater degree of
control over the program execution.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{cmd}

    The command to execute

{descriptorspec}

    An indexed array where the key represents the descriptor number and the
    value represents how PHP will pass that descriptor to the child process. 0
    is stdin, 1 is stdout, while 2 is stderr.

    Each element can be:
      + An array describing the pipe to pass to the process. The first element
        is the descriptor type and the second element is an option for the
        given type. Valid types are pipe (the second element is either r to
        pass the read end of the pipe to the process, or w to pass the write
        end) and file (the second element is a filename).
      + A stream resource representing a real file descriptor (e.g. opened
        file, a socket, STDIN).

    The file descriptor numbers are not limited to 0, 1 and 2 - you may
    specify any valid file descriptor number and it will be passed to the
    child process. This allows your script to interoperate with other scripts
    that run as "co-processes". In particular, this is useful for passing
    passphrases to programs like PGP, GPG and openssl in a more secure manner.
    It is also useful for reading status information provided by those
    programs on auxiliary file descriptors.

{pipes}

    Will be set to an indexed array of file pointers that correspond to PHP's
    end of any pipes that are created.

{cwd}

    The initial working dir for the command. This must be an absolute
    directory path, or NULL if you want to use the default value (the working
    dir of the current PHP process)

{env}

    An array with the environment variables for the command that will be run,
    or NULL to use the same environment as the current PHP process

{other_options}

    Allows you to specify additional options. Currently supported options
    include:
      + suppress_errors (windows only): suppresses errors generated by this
        function when it's set to TRUE
      + bypass_shell (windows only): bypass cmd.exe shell when set to TRUE

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns a resource representing the process, which should be freed using 
|proc_close| when you are finished with it. On failure returns FALSE.

==============================================================================
*Changelog*

Version                           Description
5.2.1   Added the bypass_shell option to the {other_options} parameter.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 A proc_open() example

<?php >
    $descriptorspec = array(
       0 => array("pipe", "r"),  // stdin is a pipe that the child will read from
       1 => array("pipe", "w"),  // stdout is a pipe that the child will write to
       2 => array("file", "/tmp/error-output.txt", "a") //
     stderr is a file to write to
    );

    $cwd = '/tmp';
    $env = array('some_option' => 'aeiou');

    $process = proc_open('php', $descriptorspec, $pipes, $cwd, $env);

    if (is_resource($process)) {
        // $pipes now looks like this:
        // 0 => writeable handle connected to child stdin
        // 1 => readable handle connected to child stdout
        // Any error output will be appended to /tmp/error-output.txt

        fwrite($pipes[0], '<?php print_r($_ENV); ?>');
        fclose($pipes[0]);

        echo stream_get_contents($pipes[1]);
        fclose($pipes[1]);

        // It is important that you close any pipes before calling
        // proc_close in order to avoid a deadlock
        $return_value = proc_close($process);

        echo "command returned $return_value\n";
    }
<?>

The above example will output something similar to:

Array
(
    [some_option] => aeiou
    [PWD] => /tmp
    [SHLVL] => 1
    [_] => /usr/local/bin/php
)
command returned 0

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    Windows compatibility: Descriptors beyond 2 (stderr) are made available to
    the child process as inheritable handles, but since the Windows
    architecture does not associate file descriptor numbers with low-level
    handles, the child process does not (yet) have a means of accessing those
    handles. Stdin, stdout and stderr work as expected.

    Note:

    If you only need a uni-directional (one-way) process pipe, use |popen|
    instead, as it is much easier to use.
