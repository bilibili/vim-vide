pcntl_wait

(PHP 5, PHP 7)

pcntl_wait — Waits on or returns the status of a forked child

==============================================================================
*Description*

    int pcntl_wait ( int &$status [, int $options = 0 ] )~

The wait function suspends execution of the current process until a child has
exited, or until a signal is delivered whose action is to terminate the
current process or to call a signal handling function. If a child has already
exited by the time of the call (a so-called "zombie" process), the function
returns immediately. Any system resources used by the child are freed. Please
see your system's wait(2) man page for specific details as to how wait works
on your system.

    Note:

    This function is equivalent to calling |pcntl_waitpid| with a -1 {pid} and
    no {options}.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{status}

    pcntl_wait() will store status information in the {status} parameter which
    can be evaluated using the following functions: |pcntl_wifexited|, 
    |pcntl_wifstopped|, |pcntl_wifsignaled|, |pcntl_wexitstatus|, 
    |pcntl_wtermsig| and |pcntl_wstopsig|.

{options}

    If wait3 is available on your system (mostly BSD-style systems), you can
    provide the optional {options} parameter. If this parameter is not
    provided, wait will be used for the system call. If wait3 is not
    available, providing a value for {options } will have no effect. The value
    of {options } is the value of zero or more of the following two constants
    OR'ed together:

                        Possible values for {options}
    WNOHANG   Return immediately if no child has exited.
    WUNTRACED Return for children which are stopped, and whose status has not
              been reported.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

pcntl_wait() returns the process ID of the child which exited, -1 on error or
zero if WNOHANG was provided as an option (on wait3-available systems) and no
child was available.
