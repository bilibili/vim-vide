dbase_open

(PHP 5 < 5.3.0, dbase 5, dbase 7)

dbase_open — Opens a database

==============================================================================
*Description*

    resource dbase_open ( string $filename , int $mode )~

dbase_open() opens a dBase database with the given access mode.

    Note: When safe mode is enabled, PHP checks whether the files or
    directories being operated upon have the same UID (owner) as the script
    that is being executed.

    Note:

    This function is affected by open_basedir.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{filename}

    The name of the database. It can be a relative or absolute path to the
    file where dBase will store your data.

{mode}

    An integer which correspond to those for the `open()` system call
    (Typically 0 means read-only, 1 means write-only, and 2 means read and
    write).

        Note:

        You can't open a dBase file in write-only mode as the function will
        fail to read the headers information and thus you can't use 1 as
        {mode}.

    As of dbase 7.0.0 you can use DBASE_RDONLY and DBASE_RDWR, respectively,
    to specify the {mode}.

==============================================================================
*Changelog*

  Version                        Description
dbase 7.0.0 The return value is now a resource instead of an int.
