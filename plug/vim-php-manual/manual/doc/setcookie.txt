setcookie

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

setcookie — Send a cookie

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool setcookie ( string $name [, string $value = "" [, int~
    $expire = 0 [, string $path = "" [, string $domain =~
    "" [, bool $secure = false [, bool $httponly = false ]]]]]] )~

setcookie() defines a cookie to be sent along with the rest of the HTTP
headers. Like other headers, cookies must be sent before any output from your
script (this is a protocol restriction). This requires that you place calls to
this function prior to any output, including <html> and <head> tags as well as
any whitespace.

Once the cookies have been set, they can be accessed on the next page load
with the $_COOKIE array. Cookie values may also exist in $_REQUEST.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

>> RFC 6265 provides the normative reference on how each setcookie() parameter
is interpreted.

{name}

    The name of the cookie.

{value}

    The value of the cookie. This value is stored on the clients computer; do
    not store sensitive information. Assuming the {name} is 'cookiename', this
    value is retrieved through $_COOKIE['cookiename']

{expire}

    The time the cookie expires. This is a Unix timestamp so is in number of
    seconds since the epoch. In other words, you'll most likely set this with
    the |time| function plus the number of seconds before you want it to
    expire. Or you might use |mktime|. time()+60*60*24*30 will set the cookie
    to expire in 30 days. If set to 0, or omitted, the cookie will expire at
    the end of the session (when the browser closes).

        Note:

        You may notice the {expire} parameter takes on a Unix timestamp, as
        opposed to the date format Wdy, DD-Mon-YYYY HH:MM:SS GMT, this is
        because PHP does this conversion internally.

{path}

    The path on the server in which the cookie will be available on. If set to
    '/', the cookie will be available within the entire {domain}. If set to '/
    foo/', the cookie will only be available within the /foo/ directory and
    all sub-directories such as /foo/bar/ of {domain}. The default value is
    the current directory that the cookie is being set in.

{domain}

    The (sub)domain that the cookie is available to. Setting this to a
    subdomain (such as 'www.example.com') will make the cookie available to
    that subdomain and all other sub-domains of it (i.e. w2.www.example.com).
    To make the cookie available to the whole domain (including all subdomains
    of it), simply set the value to the domain name ('example.com', in this
    case).

    Older browsers still implementing the deprecated >> RFC 2109 may require a
    leading . to match all subdomains.

{secure}

    Indicates that the cookie should only be transmitted over a secure HTTPS
    connection from the client. When set to TRUE, the cookie will only be set
    if a secure connection exists. On the server-side, it's on the programmer
    to send this kind of cookie only on secure connection (e.g. with respect
    to $_SERVER["HTTPS"]).

{httponly}

    When TRUE the cookie will be made accessible only through the HTTP
    protocol. This means that the cookie won't be accessible by scripting
    languages, such as JavaScript. It has been suggested that this setting can
    effectively help to reduce identity theft through XSS attacks (although it
    is not supported by all browsers), but that claim is often disputed. Added
    in PHP 5.2.0. TRUE or FALSE

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

If output exists prior to calling this function, setcookie() will fail and
return FALSE. If setcookie() successfully runs, it will return TRUE. This does
not indicate whether the user accepted the cookie.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Some examples follow how to send cookies:

Example #1 setcookie() send example

<?php >
    $value = 'something from somewhere';

    setcookie("TestCookie", $value);
    setcookie("TestCookie", $value, time()+3600);  /* expire in 1 hour */
    setcookie("TestCookie", $value, time()+3600, "/~rasmus/", "example.com", 1);
<?>

Note that the value portion of the cookie will automatically be urlencoded
when you send the cookie, and when it is received, it is automatically decoded
and assigned to a variable by the same name as the cookie name. If you don't
want this, you can use |setrawcookie| instead if you are using PHP 5. To see
the contents of our test cookie in a script, simply use one of the following
examples:

<?php >
    // Print an individual cookie
    echo $_COOKIE["TestCookie"];

    // Another way to debug/test is to view all cookies
    print_r($_COOKIE);
<?>

Example #2 setcookie() delete example

When deleting a cookie you should assure that the expiration date is in the
past, to trigger the removal mechanism in your browser. Examples follow how to
delete cookies sent in previous example:

<?php >
    // set the expiration date to one hour ago
    setcookie("TestCookie", "", time() - 3600);
    setcookie("TestCookie", "", time() - 3600, "/~rasmus/", "example.com", 1);
<?>

Example #3 setcookie() and arrays

You may also set array cookies by using array notation in the cookie name.
This has the effect of setting as many cookies as you have array elements, but
when the cookie is received by your script, the values are all placed in an
array with the cookie's name:

<?php >
    // set the cookies
    setcookie("cookie[three]", "cookiethree");
    setcookie("cookie[two]", "cookietwo");
    setcookie("cookie[one]", "cookieone");

    // after the page reloads, print them out
    if (isset($_COOKIE['cookie'])) {
        foreach ($_COOKIE['cookie'] as $name => $value) {
            $name = htmlspecialchars($name);
            $value = htmlspecialchars($value);
            echo "$name : $value <br />\n";
        }
    }
<?>

The above example will output:

three : cookiethree
two : cookietwo
one : cookieone

==============================================================================
*Changelog*

Version                              Description
5.5.0   A Max-Age attribute is now included in the Set-Cookie header sent to
        the client.
5.2.0   The {httponly} parameter was added.

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    You can use output buffering to send output prior to the call of this
    function, with the overhead of all of your output to the browser being
    buffered in the server until you send it. You can do this by calling 
    |ob_start| and |ob_end_flush| in your script, or setting the
    output_buffering configuration directive on in your php.ini or server
    configuration files.

    Note:

    If the PHP directive register_globals is set to on then cookie values will
    also be made into variables. In our examples below, $TestCookie will
    exist. It's recommended to use $_COOKIE.

Common Pitfalls:

  * Cookies will not become visible until the next loading of a page that the
    cookie should be visible for. To test if a cookie was successfully set,
    check for the cookie on a next loading page before the cookie expires.
    Expire time is set via the {expire} parameter. A nice way to debug the
    existence of cookies is by simply calling print_r($_COOKIE);.
  * Cookies must be deleted with the same parameters as they were set with. If
    the value argument is an empty string, or FALSE, and all other arguments
    match a previous call to setcookie, then the cookie with the specified
    name will be deleted from the remote client. This is internally achieved
    by setting value to 'deleted' and expiration time to one year in past.
  * Because setting a cookie with a value of FALSE will try to delete the
    cookie, you should not use boolean values. Instead, use 0 for FALSE and 1
    for TRUE.
  * Cookies names can be set as array names and will be available to your PHP
    scripts as arrays but separate cookies are stored on the user's system.
    Consider |explode| to set one cookie with multiple names and values. It is
    not recommended to use |serialize| for this purpose, because it can result
    in security holes.

Multiple calls to setcookie() are performed in the order called.
