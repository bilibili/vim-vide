yaz_search — Prepares for a search

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool yaz_search ( resource $id , string $type , string $query )~

yaz_search() prepares for a search on the given connection.

Like |yaz_connect| this function is non-blocking and only prepares for a
search to be executed later when |yaz_wait| is called.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{id}

    The connection resource returned by |yaz_connect|.

{type}

    This parameter represents the query type - only "rpn" is supported now in
    which case the third argument specifies a Type-1 query in prefix query
    notation.

{query}

    The RPN query is a textual representation of the Type-1 query as defined
    by the Z39.50 standard. However, in the text representation as used by YAZ
    a prefix notation is used, that is the operator precedes the operands. The
    query string is a sequence of tokens where white space is ignored unless
    surrounded by double quotes. Tokens beginning with an at-character (@) are
    considered operators, otherwise they are treated as search terms.

                                RPN Operators
     Construct                            Description
    @and query1  intersection of query1 and query2
    query2
    @or query1   union of query1 and query2
    query2
    @not query1  query1 and not query2
    query2
    @set name    result set reference
    @attrset set specifies attribute-set for query. This construction is only
    query        allowed once - in the beginning of the whole query
    @attr [set]  applies attribute to query. The type and value are integers
    type=value   specifying the attribute-type and attribute-value
    query        respectively. The set, if given, specifies the attribute-set.

    You can find information about attributes at the >> Z39.50 Maintenance
    Agency site.

        Note:

        If you would like to use a more friendly notation, use the CCL parser
        - functions |yaz_ccl_conf| and |yaz_ccl_parse|.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 Query Examples

You can search for simple terms, like this:

computer

which matches documents where "computer" occur. No attributes are specified.

The query

"knuth donald"

matches documents where "knuth donald" occur (provided that the server
supports phrase search).

This query applies two attributes for the same phrase.
@attr 1=1003 @attr 4=1 "knuth donald"
First attribute is type 1 (Bib-1 use), attribute value is 1003 (Author).
Second attribute has is type 4 (structure), value 1 (phrase), so this should
match documents where Donald Knuth is author.

The query

@and @or a b @not @or c d e

would in infix notation look like (a or b) and ((c or d) not e).

Another, more complex, one:

@attrset gils @and @attr 1=4 art @attr 1=2000 company

The query as a whole uses the GILS attributeset. The query matches documents
where art occur in the title (GILS,BIB-1) and in which company occur as
Distributor (GILS).
