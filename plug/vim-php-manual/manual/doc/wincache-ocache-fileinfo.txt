    cache
  * total_hit_count - number of times the compiled opcode have been served
    from the cache
  * total_miss_count - number of times the compiled opcode have not been found

    false if the metadata is for the global cache
  * file_entries - an array that contains the information about all the cached
    files:
      + file_name - absolute file name of the cached file
      + add_time - time in seconds since the file has been added to the opcode
        cache
      + use_time - time in seconds since the file has been accessed in the
        opcode cache
      + last_check - time in seconds since the file has been checked for
        modifications
      + hit_count - number of times the file has been served from the cache
      + function_count - number of functions in the cached file
      + class_count - number of classes in the cached file

    [total_miss_count] => 201
    [file_entries] => Array
        (
            [1] => Array
                (
                    [file_name] => c:\inetpub\wwwroot\checkcache.php
                    [add_time] => 17356
                    [use_time] => 7
                    [last_check] => 10
                    [hit_count] => 454
                    [function_count] => 0
                    [class_count] => 1
                )
            [2] => Array (...iterates for each cached file)
        )
