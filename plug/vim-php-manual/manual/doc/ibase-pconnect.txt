(PHP 5, PHP 7)

ibase_pconnect — Open a persistent connection to an InterBase database

==============================================================================
*Description*

    resource ibase_pconnect ([ string $database [, string $username [, string~
    $password [, string $charset [, int $buffers [, int $dialect [, string~
    $role [, int $sync ]]]]]]]] )~

Opens a persistent connection to an InterBase database.

ibase_pconnect() acts very much like |ibase_connect| with two major
differences.

First, when connecting, the function will first try to find a (persistent)
link that's already opened with the same parameters. If one is found, an
identifier for it will be returned instead of opening a new connection.

Second, the connection to the InterBase server will not be closed when the
execution of the script ends. Instead, the link will remain open for future
use (|ibase_close| will not close links established by ibase_pconnect()). This
type of link is therefore called 'persistent'.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{database}

    The {database} argument has to be a valid path to database file on the
    server it resides on. If the server is not local, it must be prefixed with
    either 'hostname:' (TCP/IP), '//hostname/' (NetBEUI) or 'hostname@' (IPX/
    SPX), depending on the connection protocol used.

{username}

    The user name. Can be set with the ibase.default_user php.ini directive.

{password}

    The password for {username}. Can be set with the ibase.default_password
    php.ini directive.

{charset}

    {charset} is the default character set for a database.

{buffers}

    {buffers} is the number of database buffers to allocate for the
    server-side cache. If 0 or omitted, server chooses its own default.

{dialect}

    {dialect} selects the default SQL dialect for any statement executed
    within a connection, and it defaults to the highest one supported by
    client libraries. Functional only with InterBase 6 and up.

{role}

    Functional only with InterBase 5 and up.

{sync}

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns an InterBase link identifier on success, or FALSE on error.
