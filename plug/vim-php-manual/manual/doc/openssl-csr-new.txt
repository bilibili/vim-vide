openssl_csr_new

(PHP 4 >= 4.2.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

openssl_csr_new — Generates a CSR

==============================================================================
*Description*

    mixed openssl_csr_new ( array $dn , resource &$privkey [, array~
    $configargs [, array $extraattribs ]] )~

openssl_csr_new() generates a new CSR (Certificate Signing Request) based on
the information provided by {dn}, which represents the Distinguished Name to
be used in the certificate.

    Note: You need to have a valid openssl.cnf installed for this function to
    operate correctly. See the notes under the installation section for more
    information.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{dn}

    The Distinguished Name to be used in the certificate.

{privkey}

    {privkey} should be set to a private key that was previously generated by 
    |openssl_pkey_new| (or otherwise obtained from the other openssl_pkey
    family of functions). The corresponding public portion of the key will be
    used to sign the CSR.

{configargs}

    By default, the information in your system openssl.conf is used to
    initialize the request; you can specify a configuration file section by
    setting the config_section_section key of {configargs}. You can also
    specify an alternative openssl configuration file by setting the value of
    the config key to the path of the file you want to use. The following
    keys, if present in {configargs} behave as their equivalents in the
    openssl.conf, as listed in the table below.

    digest_alg         string  default_md      Selects which digest method to

    req_extensions     string  req_extensions  Selects which extensions should

                                               Specifies how many bits should
    private_key_bits   integer default_bits    be used to generate a private
                                               key
                                               Specifies the type of private
                                               key to create. This can be one
                                               of OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_DSA,
                                               OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_DH or
    private_key_type   integer none            OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_RSA. The
                                               default value is
                                               OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_RSA which is
                                               currently the only supported
                                               key type.
    encrypt_key        boolean encrypt_key     Should an exported key (with
                                               passphrase) be encrypted?
    encrypt_key_cipher integer none            One of cipher constants.

{extraattribs}

    {extraattribs} is used to specify additional configuration options for the
    CSR. Both {dn} and {extraattribs} are associative arrays whose keys are
    converted to OIDs and applied to the relevant part of the request.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns the CSR.

*Examples*

Example #1 Creating a self-signed-certificate

<?php >
    // Fill in data for the distinguished name to be used in the cert
    // You must change the values of these keys to match your name and
    // company, or more precisely, the name and company of the person/site
    // that you are generating the certificate for.
    // For SSL certificates, the commonName is usually the domain name of
    // that will be using the certificate, but for S/MIME certificates,
    // the commonName will be the name of the individual who will use the
    // certificate.
    $dn = array(
        "countryName" => "UK",
        "stateOrProvinceName" => "Somerset",
        "localityName" => "Glastonbury",
        "organizationName" => "The Brain Room Limited",
        "organizationalUnitName" => "PHP Documentation Team",
        "commonName" => "Wez Furlong",
        "emailAddress" => "wez@example.com"
    );

    // Generate a new private (and public) key pair
    $privkey = openssl_pkey_new();

    // Generate a certificate signing request
    $csr = openssl_csr_new($dn, $privkey);

    // You will usually want to create a self-signed certificate at this
    // point until your CA fulfills your request.
    // This creates a self-signed cert that is valid for 365 days
    $sscert = openssl_csr_sign($csr, null, $privkey, 365);

    // Now you will want to preserve your private key, CSR and self-signed
    // cert so that they can be installed into your web server, mail server
    // or mail client (depending on the intended use of the certificate).
    // This example shows how to get those things into variables, but you
    // can also store them directly into files.
    // Typically, you will send the CSR on to your CA who will then issue
    // you with the "real" certificate.
    openssl_csr_export($csr, $csrout) and var_dump($csrout);
    openssl_x509_export($sscert, $certout) and var_dump($certout);
    openssl_pkey_export($privkey, $pkeyout, "mypassword") and var_dump($pkeyout);

    // Show any errors that occurred here
    while (($e = openssl_error_string()) !== false) {
        echo $e . "\n";
    }
