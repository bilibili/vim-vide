mysqlnd_ms_xa_begin

(PECL mysqlnd_ms < 1.6.0)

mysqlnd_ms_xa_begin — Starts a distributed/XA transaction among MySQL servers

==============================================================================
*Description*

    int mysqlnd_ms_xa_begin ( mixed $connection , string $gtrid [, int~
    $timeout ] )~

Starts a XA transaction among MySQL servers. PECL/mysqlnd_ms acts as a
transaction coordinator the distributed transaction.

Once a global transaction has been started, the plugin injects appropriate XA
BEGIN SQL statements on all MySQL servers used in the following. The global
transaction is either ended by calling |mysqlnd_ms_xa_commit|, 
|mysqlnd_ms_xa_rollback| or by an implicit rollback in case of an error.

During a global transaction, the plugin tracks all server switches, for
example, when switching from one MySQL shard to another MySQL shard.
Immediately before a query is run on a server that has not been participating
in the global transaction yet, XA BEGIN is executed on the server. From a
users perspective the injection happens during a call to a query execution
function such as mysqli_query(). Should the injection fail an error is
reported to the caller of the query execution function. The failing server
does not become a participant in the global transaction. The user may retry
executing a query on the server and hereby retry injecting XA BEGIN, abort the
global transaction because not all required servers can participate, or ignore
and continue the global without the failed server.

Reasons to fail executing XA BEGIN include but are not limited to a server
being unreachable or the server having an open, concurrent XA transaction
using the same xid.

Please note, global and local transactions are mutually exclusive. You cannot
start a XA transaction when you have a local transaction open. The local
transaction must be ended first. The plugin tries to detect this conflict as
early as possible. It monitors API calls for controlling local transactions to
learn about the current state. However, if using SQL statements for local
transactions such as BEGIN, the plugin may not know the current state and the
conflict is not detected before XA BEGIN is injected and executed.

The use of other XA resources but MySQL servers is not supported by the
function. To carry out a global transaction among, for example, a MySQL server
and another vendors database system, you should issue the systems SQL commands
yourself.

    Note: Experimental

    The feature is currently under development. There may be issues and/or
    feature limitations. Do not use in production environments.

*Parameters*

{connection}

    A MySQL connection handle obtained from any of the connect functions of
    the mysqli, mysql or PDO_MYSQL extensions.

{gtrid}

    Global transaction identifier (gtrid). The gtrid is a binary string up to
    64 bytes long. Please note, depending on your character set settings, 64
    characters may require more than 64 bytes to store.

    In accordance with the MySQL SQL syntax, XA transactions use identifiers
    made of three parts. An xid consists of a global transaction identifier
    (gtrid), a branch qualifier (bqual) and a format identifier (formatID).
    Only the global transaction identifier can and needs to be set.

    The branch qualifier and format identifier are set automatically. The
    details should be considered implementation dependent, which may change
    without prior notice. In version 1.6 the branch qualifier is consecutive
    number which is incremented whenever a participant joins the global
    transaction.

{timeout}

    Timeout in seconds. The default value is 60 seconds.

    The timeout is a hint to the garbage collection. If a transaction is
    recorded to take longer than expected, the garbage collection begins
    checking the transactions status.

    Setting a low value may make the garbage collection check the progress too
    often. Please note, checking the status of a global transaction may
    involve connecting to all recorded participants and possibly issuing
    queries on the servers.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE if there is no open local or global transaction and a new global
transaction can be started. Otherwise, returns FALSE
