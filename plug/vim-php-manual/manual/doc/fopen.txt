fopen

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

fopen — Opens file or URL

==============================================================================
*Description*

    resource fopen ( string $filename , string $mode [, bool~
    $use_include_path = false [, resource $context ]] )~

fopen() binds a named resource, specified by {filename}, to a stream.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{filename}

    If {filename} is of the form "scheme://...", it is assumed to be a URL and
    PHP will search for a protocol handler (also known as a wrapper) for that
    scheme. If no wrappers for that protocol are registered, PHP will emit a
    notice to help you track potential problems in your script and then
    continue as though {filename} specifies a regular file.

    If PHP has decided that {filename} specifies a local file, then it will
    try to open a stream on that file. The file must be accessible to PHP, so
    you need to ensure that the file access permissions allow this access. If
    you have enabled safe mode or open_basedir further restrictions may apply.

    If PHP has decided that {filename} specifies a registered protocol, and
    that protocol is registered as a network URL, PHP will check to make sure
    that allow_url_fopen is enabled. If it is switched off, PHP will emit a
    warning and the fopen call will fail.

        Note:

        The list of supported protocols can be found in Supported Protocols
        and Wrappers. Some protocols (also referred to as wrappers) support
        context and/or php.ini options. Refer to the specific page for the
        protocol in use for a list of options which can be set. (e.g. php.ini
        value user_agent used by the http wrapper).

    On the Windows platform, be careful to escape any backslashes used in the
    path to the file, or use forward slashes.
    <?php >
    $handle = fopen("c:\\folder\\resource.txt", "r");
<    ?>

{mode}

    The {mode} parameter specifies the type of access you require to the
    stream. It may be any of the following:

              A list of possible modes for fopen() using {mode}
    {mode}                             Description
    'r'    Open for reading only; place the file pointer at the beginning of
           the file.
    'r+'   Open for reading and writing; place the file pointer at the
           beginning of the file.
           Open for writing only; place the file pointer at the beginning of
    'w'    the file and truncate the file to zero length. If the file does not
           exist, attempt to create it.
           Open for reading and writing; place the file pointer at the
    'w+'   beginning of the file and truncate the file to zero length. If the
           file does not exist, attempt to create it.
           Open for writing only; place the file pointer at the end of the
    'a'    file. If the file does not exist, attempt to create it. In this
           mode, |fseek| has no effect, writes are always appended.
           Open for reading and writing; place the file pointer at the end of
    'a+'   the file. If the file does not exist, attempt to create it. In this
           mode, |fseek| only affects the reading position, writes are always
           appended.
           Create and open for writing only; place the file pointer at the
           beginning of the file. If the file already exists, the fopen() call
    'x'    will fail by returning FALSE and generating an error of level
           E_WARNING. If the file does not exist, attempt to create it. This
           is equivalent to specifying O_EXCL|O_CREAT flags for the underlying
           open(2) system call.
    'x+'   Create and open for reading and writing; otherwise it has the same
           behavior as 'x'.
           Open the file for writing only. If the file does not exist, it is
           created. If it exists, it is neither truncated (as opposed to 'w'),
           nor the call to this function fails (as is the case with 'x'). The
    'c'    file pointer is positioned on the beginning of the file. This may
           be useful if it's desired to get an advisory lock (see |flock|)
           before attempting to modify the file, as using 'w' could truncate
           the file before the lock was obtained (if truncation is desired, 
           |ftruncate| can be used after the lock is requested).
    'c+'   Open the file for reading and writing; otherwise it has the same
           behavior as 'c'.
    'e'    Set close-on-exec flag on the opened file descriptor. Only
           available in PHP compiled on POSIX.1-2008 conform systems.

        Note:

        Different operating system families have different line-ending
        conventions. When you write a text file and want to insert a line
        break, you need to use the correct line-ending character(s) for your
        operating system. Unix based systems use \n as the line ending
        character, Windows based systems use \r\n as the line ending
        characters and Macintosh based systems use \r as the line ending
        character.

        If you use the wrong line ending characters when writing your files,
        you might find that other applications that open those files will
        "look funny".

        Windows offers a text-mode translation flag ('t') which will
        transparently translate \n to \r\n when working with the file. In
        contrast, you can also use 'b' to force binary mode, which will not
        translate your data. To use these flags, specify either 'b' or 't' as
        the last character of the {mode} parameter.

        The default translation mode depends on the SAPI and version of PHP
        that you are using, so you are encouraged to always specify the
        appropriate flag for portability reasons. You should use the 't' mode
        if you are working with plain-text files and you use \n to delimit
        your line endings in your script, but expect your files to be readable
        with applications such as notepad. You should use the 'b' in all other
        cases.

        If you do not specify the 'b' flag when working with binary files, you
        may experience strange problems with your data, including broken image
        files and strange problems with \r\n characters.

        Note:

        For portability, it is strongly recommended that you always use the
        'b' flag when opening files with fopen().

        Note:

        Again, for portability, it is also strongly recommended that you
        re-write code that uses or relies upon the 't' mode so that it uses
        the correct line endings and 'b' mode instead.

{use_include_path}

    The optional third {use_include_path} parameter can be set to '1' or TRUE
    if you want to search for the file in the include_path, too.

{context}


        Note: Context support was added with PHP 5.0.0. For a description of
        contexts, refer to Streams.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns a file pointer resource on success, or FALSE on error.

==============================================================================
*Errors/Exceptions*

If the open fails, an error of level E_WARNING is generated. You may use @ to
suppress this warning.

==============================================================================
*Changelog*

Version                              Description
7.0.16, The 'e' option were added.
7.1.2
5.2.6   The 'c' and 'c+' options were added
        As of PHP 4.3.2, the default mode is set to binary for all platforms
        that distinguish between binary and text mode. If you are having
4.3.2   problems with your scripts after upgrading, try using the 't' flag as
        a workaround until you have made your script more portable as
        mentioned before

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 fopen() examples

<?php >
    $handle = fopen("/home/rasmus/file.txt", "r");
    $handle = fopen("/home/rasmus/file.gif", "wb");
    $handle = fopen("http://www.example.com/", "r");
    $handle = fopen("ftp://user:password@example.com/somefile.txt", "w");
<?>

==============================================================================
*Notes*

Warning

When using SSL, Microsoft IIS will violate the protocol by closing the
connection without sending a close_notify indicator. PHP will report this as
"SSL: Fatal Protocol Error" when you reach the end of the data. To work around
this, the value of error_reporting should be lowered to a level that does not
include warnings. PHP can detect buggy IIS server software when you open the
stream using the https:// wrapper and will suppress the warning. When using 
|fsockopen| to create an ssl:// socket, the developer is responsible for
detecting and suppressing this warning.

    Note: When safe mode is enabled, PHP checks whether the directory in which
    the script is operating has the same UID (owner) as the script that is
    being executed.

    Note:

    If you are experiencing problems with reading and writing to files and
    you're using the server module version of PHP, remember to make sure that
    the files and directories you're using are accessible to the server
    process.

    Note:

    This function may also succeed when {filename} is a directory. If you are
    unsure whether {filename} is a file or a directory, you may need to use
    the |is_dir| function before calling fopen().
