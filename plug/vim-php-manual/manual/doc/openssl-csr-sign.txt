openssl_csr_sign

(PHP 4 >= 4.2.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

openssl_csr_sign — Sign a CSR with another certificate (or itself) and
generate a certificate

==============================================================================
*Description*

    resource openssl_csr_sign ( mixed $csr , mixed $cacert , mixed $priv_key~
    , int $days [, array $configargs [, int $serial = 0 ]] )~

openssl_csr_sign() generates an x509 certificate resource from the given CSR.

    Note: You need to have a valid openssl.cnf installed for this function to
    operate correctly. See the notes under the installation section for more
    information.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{csr}

    A CSR previously generated by |openssl_csr_new|. It can also be the path
    to a PEM encoded CSR when specified as file://path/to/csr or an exported
    string generated by |openssl_csr_export|.

{cacert}

    The generated certificate will be signed by {cacert}. If {cacert} is NULL,
    the generated certificate will be a self-signed certificate.

{priv_key}

    {priv_key} is the private key that corresponds to {cacert}.

{days}

    {days} specifies the length of time for which the generated certificate
    will be valid, in days.

{configargs}

    You can finetune the CSR signing by {configargs}. See |openssl_csr_new|
    for more information about {configargs}.

{serial}

    An optional the serial number of issued certificate. If not specified it
    will default to 0.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns an x509 certificate resource on success, FALSE on failure.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 openssl_csr_sign() example - signing a CSR (how to implement your
own CA)

<?php >
    // Let's assume that this script is set to receive a CSR that has
    // been pasted into a textarea from another page
    $csrdata = $_POST["CSR"];

    // We will sign the request using our own "certificate authority"
    // certificate.  You can use any certificate to sign another, but
    // the process is worthless unless the signing certificate is trusted
    // by the software/users that will deal with the newly signed certificate

    // We need our CA cert and its private key
    $cacert = "file://path/to/ca.crt";
    $privkey = array("file://path/to/ca.key", "your_ca_key_passphrase");

    $usercert = openssl_csr_sign($csrdata, $cacert, $privkey, 365);

    // Now display the generated certificate so that the user can
    // copy and paste it into their local configuration (such as a file
    // to hold the certificate for their SSL server)
    openssl_x509_export($usercert, $certout);
    echo $certout;

    // Show any errors that occurred here
    while (($e = openssl_error_string()) !== false) {
        echo $e . "\n";
    }
