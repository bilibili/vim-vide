win32_query_service_status — Queries the status of a service

==============================================================================
*Description*

    mixed win32_query_service_status ( string $servicename [, string $machine~
    ] )~

Queries the current status for a service, returning an array of information.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{servicename}

    The short name of the service.

{machine}

    The optional machine name. If omitted, the local machine will be used.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns an array consisting of the following information on success, FALSE if
there is a problem with the parameters or a Win32 Error Code on failure.

{ServiceType}

    The dwServiceType. See Win32Service Service Type Bitmasks.

{CurrentState}

    The dwCurrentState. See Win32Service Service Status Constants.

{ControlsAccepted}

    Which service controls are accepted by the service. See Win32Service
    Service Control Message Accepted Bitmasks.

{Win32ExitCode}

    If the service exited, the return code from the process.

{ServiceSpecificExitCode}

    If the service exited with an error condition, the service specific code
    that is logged in the event log is visible here.

{CheckPoint}

    If the service is shutting down, holds the current check point number.
    This is used by the SCM as a kind of heart-beat to detect a wedged service
    process. The value of the check point is best interpreted in conjunction
    with the WaitHint value.

{WaitHint}

    If the service is shutting down it will set WaitHint to a checkpoint value
    that will indicate 100% completion. This can be used to implement a
    progress indicator.

{ProcessId}

    The Windows process identifier. If 0, the process is not running.

{ServiceFlags}

    The dwServiceFlags. See Win32Service Service Service Flag Constants.
