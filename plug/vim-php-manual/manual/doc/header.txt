header

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

header — Send a raw HTTP header

==============================================================================
*Description*

    void header ( string $string [, bool $replace = true [, int~
    $http_response_code ]] )~

header() is used to send a raw HTTP header. See the >> HTTP/1.1 specification
for more information on HTTP headers.

Remember that header() must be called before any actual output is sent, either
by normal HTML tags, blank lines in a file, or from PHP. It is a very common
error to read code with |include|, or |require|, functions, or another file
access function, and have spaces or empty lines that are output before header
() is called. The same problem exists when using a single PHP/HTML file.
<html>
<?php >
    /* This will give an error. Note the output
     * above, which is before the header() call */
    header('Location: http://www.example.com/');
    exit;
<?>

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{string}

    The header string.

    There are two special-case header calls. The first is a header that starts
    with the string "HTTP/" (case is not significant), which will be used to
    figure out the HTTP status code to send. For example, if you have
    configured Apache to use a PHP script to handle requests for missing files
    (using the ErrorDocument directive), you may want to make sure that your
    script generates the proper status code.

    <?php >
    header("HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found");
<    ?>

    The second special case is the "Location:" header. Not only does it send
    this header back to the browser, but it also returns a REDIRECT (302)
    status code to the browser unless the 201 or a 3xx status code has already
    been set.

    <?php >
    header("Location: http://www.example.com/"); /* Redirect browser */

    /* Make sure that code below does not get executed when we redirect. */
    exit;
<    ?>

{replace}

    The optional {replace} parameter indicates whether the header should
    replace a previous similar header, or add a second header of the same
    type. By default it will replace, but if you pass in FALSE as the second
    argument you can force multiple headers of the same type. For example:

    <?php >
    header('WWW-Authenticate: Negotiate');
    header('WWW-Authenticate: NTLM', false);
<    ?>

{http_response_code}

    Forces the HTTP response code to the specified value. Note that this
    parameter only has an effect if the {string} is not empty.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

No value is returned.

*Changelog*

Version                              Description
5.1.2   This function now prevents more than one header to be sent at once as
        a protection against header injection attacks.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 Download dialog

If you want the user to be prompted to save the data you are sending, such as
a generated PDF file, you can use the >> Content-Disposition header to supply
a recommended filename and force the browser to display the save dialog.

<?php >
    // We'll be outputting a PDF
    header('Content-Type: application/pdf');

    // It will be called downloaded.pdf
    header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="downloaded.pdf"');

    // The PDF source is in original.pdf
    readfile('original.pdf');
<?>

Example #2 Caching directives

PHP scripts often generate dynamic content that must not be cached by the
client browser or any proxy caches between the server and the client browser.
Many proxies and clients can be forced to disable caching with:

<?php >
    header("Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate"); // HTTP/1.1
    header("Expires: Sat, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT"); // Date in the past
<?>

    Note:

    You may find that your pages aren't cached even if you don't output all of
    the headers above. There are a number of options that users may be able to
    set for their browser that change its default caching behavior. By sending
    the headers above, you should override any settings that may otherwise
    cause the output of your script to be cached.

    Additionally, |session_cache_limiter| and the session.cache_limiter
    configuration setting can be used to automatically generate the correct
    caching-related headers when sessions are being used.

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    Headers will only be accessible and output when a SAPI that supports them
    is in use.

    Note:

    You can use output buffering to get around this problem, with the overhead
    of all of your output to the browser being buffered in the server until
    you send it. You can do this by calling |ob_start| and |ob_end_flush| in
    your script, or setting the output_buffering configuration directive on in
    your php.ini or server configuration files.

    Note:

    The HTTP status header line will always be the first sent to the client,
    regardless of the actual header() call being the first or not. The status
    may be overridden by calling header() with a new status line at any time
    unless the HTTP headers have already been sent.

    Note:

    There is a bug in Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01 that prevents this from
    working. There is no workaround. There is also a bug in Microsoft Internet
    Explorer 5.5 that interferes with this, which can be resolved by upgrading
    to Service Pack 2 or later.

    Note: If safe mode is enabled the uid of the script is added to the realm
    part of the WWW-Authenticate header if you set this header (used for HTTP
    Authentication).

    Note:

    Most contemporary clients accept relative URIs as argument to >> Location:
    , but some older clients require an absolute URI including the scheme,
    hostname and absolute path. You can usually use $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'],
    $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] and |dirname| to make an absolute URI from a relative
    one yourself:
    <?php >
    /
    * Redirect to a different page in the current directory that was requested *
    /
    $host  = $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];
    $uri   = rtrim(dirname($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']), '/\\');
    $extra = 'mypage.php';
    header("Location: http://$host$uri/$extra");
    exit;
<    ?>

    Note:

    Session ID is not passed with Location header even if
    session.use_trans_sid is enabled. It must by passed manually using SID
    constant.
