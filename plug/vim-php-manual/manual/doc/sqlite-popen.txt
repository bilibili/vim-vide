sqlite_popen

(PHP 5 < 5.4.0, PECL sqlite >= 1.0.0)

sqlite_popen — Opens a persistent handle to an SQLite database and create the
database if it does not exist

==============================================================================
*Description*

    resource sqlite_popen ( string $filename [, int $mode = 0666 [, string~
    &$error_message ]] )~

This function behaves identically to |sqlite_open| except that is uses the
persistent resource mechanism of PHP. For information about the meaning of the
parameters, read the |sqlite_open| manual page.

sqlite_popen() will first check to see if a persistent handle has already been
opened for the given {filename}. If it finds one, it returns that handle to
your script, otherwise it opens a fresh handle to the database.

The benefit of this approach is that you don't incur the performance cost of
re-reading the database and index schema on each page hit served by persistent
web server SAPI's (any SAPI except for regular CGI or CLI).

    Note: If you use persistent handles and have the database updated by a
    background process (perhaps via a crontab), and that process re-creates
    the database by overwriting it (either by unlinking and rebuilding, or
    moving the updated version to replace the current version), you may
    experience undefined behaviour when a persistent handle on the old version
    of the database is recycled. To avoid this situation, have your background
    processes open the same database file and perform their updates in a
    transaction.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{filename}

    The filename of the SQLite database. If the file does not exist, SQLite
    will attempt to create it. PHP must have write permissions to the file if
    data is inserted, the database schema is modified or to create the
    database if it does not exist.

{mode}

    The mode of the file. Intended to be used to open the database in
    read-only mode. Presently, this parameter is ignored by the sqlite
    library. The default value for mode is the octal value 0666 and this is
    the recommended value.

{error_message}

    Passed by reference and is set to hold a descriptive error message
    explaining why the database could not be opened if there was an error.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns a resource (database handle) on success, FALSE on error.
