serialize

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

serialize — Generates a storable representation of a value

==============================================================================
*Description*

    string serialize ( mixed $value )~

Generates a storable representation of a value.

This is useful for storing or passing PHP values around without losing their
type and structure.

To make the serialized string into a PHP value again, use |unserialize|.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{value}

    The value to be serialized. serialize() handles all types, except the 
    resource-type. You can even serialize() arrays that contain references to
    itself. Circular references inside the array/object you are serializing
    will also be stored. Any other reference will be lost.

    When serializing objects, PHP will attempt to call the member function
    __sleep() prior to serialization. This is to allow the object to do any
    last minute clean-up, etc. prior to being serialized. Likewise, when the
    object is restored using |unserialize| the __wakeup() member function is
    called.

        Note:

        Object's private members have the class name prepended to the member
        name; protected members have a '*' prepended to the member name. These
        prepended values have null bytes on either side.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns a string containing a byte-stream representation of {value} that can
be stored anywhere.

Note that this is a binary string which may include null bytes, and needs to
be stored and handled as such. For example, serialize() output should
generally be stored in a BLOB field in a database, rather than a CHAR or TEXT
field.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 serialize() example

<?php >
    // $session_data contains a multi-dimensional array with session
    // information for the current user.  We use serialize() to store
    // it in a database at the end of the request.

    $conn = odbc_connect("webdb", "php", "chicken");
    $stmt = odbc_prepare($conn,
          "UPDATE sessions SET data = ? WHERE id = ?");
    $sqldata = array (serialize($session_data), $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER']);
    if (!odbc_execute($stmt, $sqldata)) {
        $stmt = odbc_prepare($conn,
         "INSERT INTO sessions (id, data) VALUES(?, ?)");
        if (!odbc_execute($stmt, $sqldata)) {
            /* Something went wrong.. */
        }
    }
<?>

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    Note that many built-in PHP objects cannot be serialized. However, those
    with this ability either implement the Serializable interface or the magic
    __sleep() and __wakeup() methods. If an internal class does not fulfill
    any of those requirements, it cannot reliably be serialized.

    There are some historical exceptions to the above rule, where some
    internal objects could be serialized without implementing the interface or
    exposing the methods. Notably, the ArrayObject prior to PHP 5.2.0.

Warning

When serialize() serializes objects, the leading backslash is not included in
the class name of namespaced classes for maximum compatibility.
