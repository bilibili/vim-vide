password_hash

(PHP 5 >= 5.5.0, PHP 7)

password_hash — Creates a password hash

==============================================================================
*Description*

    string password_hash ( string $password , integer $algo [, array $options~
    ] )~

password_hash() creates a new password hash using a strong one-way hashing
algorithm. password_hash() is compatible with |crypt|. Therefore, password
hashes created by |crypt| can be used with password_hash().

The following algorithms are currently supported:

  * PASSWORD_DEFAULT - Use the bcrypt algorithm (default as of PHP 5.5.0).
    Note that this constant is designed to change over time as new and
    stronger algorithms are added to PHP. For that reason, the length of the
    result from using this identifier can change over time. Therefore, it is
    recommended to store the result in a database column that can expand
    beyond 60 characters (255 characters would be a good choice).
  * PASSWORD_BCRYPT - Use the CRYPT_BLOWFISH algorithm to create the hash.
    This will produce a standard |crypt| compatible hash using the "$2y$"
    identifier. The result will always be a 60 character string, or FALSE on
    failure.

Supported Options:

  * salt - to manually provide a salt to use when hashing the password. Note
    that this will override and prevent a salt from being automatically
    generated.

    If omitted, a random salt will be generated by password_hash() for each
    password hashed. This is the intended mode of operation.

    Warning

    The salt option has been deprecated as of PHP 7.0.0. It is now preferred
    to simply use the salt that is generated by default.

  * cost - which denotes the algorithmic cost that should be used. Examples of
    these values can be found on the |crypt| page.

    If omitted, a default value of 10 will be used. This is a good baseline
    cost, but you may want to consider increasing it depending on your
    hardware.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{password}

    The user's password.

    Caution

    Using the PASSWORD_BCRYPT as the algorithm, will result in the {password}
    parameter being truncated to a maximum length of 72 characters.

{algo}

    A password algorithm constant denoting the algorithm to use when hashing
    the password.

{options}

    An associative array containing options. See the password algorithm
    constants for documentation on the supported options for each algorithm.

    If omitted, a random salt will be created and the default cost will be
    used.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns the hashed password, or FALSE on failure.

The used algorithm, cost and salt are returned as part of the hash. Therefore,
all information that's needed to verify the hash is included in it. This
allows the |password_verify| function to verify the hash without needing
separate storage for the salt or algorithm information.

*Examples*

Example #1 password_hash() example

<?php >
    /**
     * We just want to hash our password using the current DEFAULT algorithm.
     * This is presently BCRYPT, and will produce a 60 character result.
     *
     * Beware that DEFAULT may change over time, so you would want to prepare
     * By allowing your storage to expand past 60 characters (255 would be good)
     */
    echo password_hash("rasmuslerdorf", PASSWORD_DEFAULT)."\n";
<?>

The above example will output something similar to:

$2y$10$.vGA1O9wmRjrwAVXD98HNOgsNpDczlqm3Jq7KnEd1rVAGv3Fykk1a

Example #2 password_hash() example setting cost manually

<?php >
    /**
     * In this case, we want to increase the default cost for BCRYPT to 12.
     * Note that we also switched to BCRYPT, which will always be 60 characters.
     */
    $options = [
        'cost' => 12,
    ];
    echo password_hash("rasmuslerdorf", PASSWORD_BCRYPT, $options)."\n";
<?>

The above example will output something similar to:

$2y$12$QjSH496pcT5CEbzjD/vtVeH03tfHKFy36d4J0Ltp3lRtee9HDxY3K

Example #3 password_hash() example setting salt manually

<?php >
    /**
     * Note that the salt here is randomly generated.
     * Never use a static salt or one that is not randomly generated.
     *
     * For the VAST majority of use-cases, let password_hash generate the salt randomly for you
     */
    $options = [
        'cost' => 11,
        'salt' => mcrypt_create_iv(22, MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM),
    ];
    echo password_hash("rasmuslerdorf", PASSWORD_BCRYPT, $options)."\n";
<?>

The above example will output something similar to:

$2y$11$q5MkhSBtlsJcNEVsYh64a.aCluzHnGog7TQAKVmQwO9C8xb.t89F.

Example #4 password_hash() example finding a good cost

<?php >
    /**
     * This code will benchmark your server to determine how high of a cost you can
     * afford. You want to set the highest cost that you can without slowing down
     * you server too much. 8-10 is a good baseline, and more is good if your servers
     * are fast enough. The code below aims for ≤ 50 milliseconds stretching time,
     * which is a good baseline for systems handling interactive logins.
     */
    $timeTarget = 0.05; // 50 milliseconds 

    $cost = 8;
    do {
        $cost++;
        $start = microtime(true);
        password_hash("test", PASSWORD_BCRYPT, ["cost" => $cost]);
        $end = microtime(true);
    } while (($end - $start) < $timeTarget);

    echo "Appropriate Cost Found: " . $cost . "\n";
<?>

The above example will output something similar to:

Appropriate Cost Found: 10

==============================================================================
*Notes*

Caution

It is strongly recommended that you do not generate your own salt for this
function. It will create a secure salt automatically for you if you do not
specify one.

As noted above, providing the salt option in PHP 7.0 will generate a
deprecation warning. Support for providing a salt manually may be removed in a
future PHP release.

    Note:

    It is recommended that you test this function on your servers, and adjust
    the cost parameter so that execution of the function takes less than 100
    milliseconds on interactive systems. The script in the above example will
    help you choose a good cost value for your hardware.

    Note: Updates to supported algorithms by this function (or changes to the
    default one) must follow the following rules:

      + Any new algorithm must be in core for at least 1 full release of PHP
        prior to becoming default. So if, for example, a new algorithm is
        added in 7.5.5, it would not be eligible for default until 7.7 (since
        7.6 would be the first full release). But if a different algorithm was
        added in 7.6.0, it would also be eligible for default at 7.7.0.
      + The default should only change in a full release (7.3.0, 8.0.0, etc)
        and not in a revision release. The only exception to this is in an
        emergency when a critical security flaw is found in the current
        default.
