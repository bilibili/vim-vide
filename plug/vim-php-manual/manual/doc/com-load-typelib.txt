com_load_typelib — Loads a Typelib

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool com_load_typelib ( string $typelib_name [, bool $case_insensitive =~
    true ] )~

Loads a type-library and registers its constants in the engine, as though they
were defined using |define|.

Note that it is much more efficient to use the  configuration setting to
pre-load and register the constants, although not so flexible.

If you have turned on  , then PHP will attempt to automatically register the
constants associated with a COM object when you instantiate it. This depends
on the interfaces provided by the COM object itself, and may not always be
possible.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{typelib_name}

    {typelib_name} can be one of the following:
      + The filename of a .tlb file or the executable module that contains the
        type library.

      + The type library GUID, followed by its version number, for example
        {00000200-0000-0010-8000-00AA006D2EA4},2,0.

      + The type library name, e.g. Microsoft OLE DB ActiveX Data Objects 1.0
        Library.

    PHP will attempt to resolve the type library in this order, as the process
    gets more and more expensive as you progress down the list; searching for
    the type library by name is handled by physically enumerating the registry
    until we find a match.

{case_insensitive}

    The {case_insensitive} behaves in the same way as the parameter with the
    same name in the |define| function.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
