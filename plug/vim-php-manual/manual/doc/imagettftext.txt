imagettftext — Write text to the image using TrueType fonts

==============================================================================
*Description*

    array imagettftext ( resource $image , float $size , float $angle , int~
    $x , int $y , int $color , string $fontfile , string $text )~

Writes the given {text} into the image using TrueType fonts.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{ image}

    An image resource, returned by one of the image creation functions, such
    as |imagecreatetruecolor|.

{size}

    The font size. Depending on your version of GD, this should be specified
    as the pixel size (GD1) or point size (GD2).

{angle}

    The angle in degrees, with 0 degrees being left-to-right reading text.
    Higher values represent a counter-clockwise rotation. For example, a value
    of 90 would result in bottom-to-top reading text.

{x}

    The coordinates given by {x} and {y} will define the basepoint of the
    first character (roughly the lower-left corner of the character). This is
    different from the |imagestring|, where {x} and {y} define the upper-left
    corner of the first character. For example, "top left" is 0, 0.

{y}

    The y-ordinate. This sets the position of the fonts baseline, not the very
    bottom of the character.

{color}

    The color index. Using the negative of a color index has the effect of
    turning off antialiasing. See |imagecolorallocate|.

{fontfile}

    The path to the TrueType font you wish to use.

    Depending on which version of the GD library PHP is using, when {fontfile}
    does not begin with a leading / then .ttf will be appended to the filename
    and the library will attempt to search for that filename along a
    library-defined font path.

    When using versions of the GD library lower than 2.0.18, a space
    character, rather than a semicolon, was used as the 'path separator' for
    different font files. Unintentional use of this feature will result in the
    warning message: Warning: Could not find/open font. For these affected
    versions, the only solution is moving the font to a path which does not
    contain spaces.

    In many cases where a font resides in the same directory as the script
    using it the following trick will alleviate any include problems.
    <?php >
    // Set the enviroment variable for GD
    putenv('GDFONTPATH=' . realpath('.'));

    // Name the font to be used (note the lack of the .ttf extension)
    $font = 'SomeFont';
<    ?>

{text}

    The text string in UTF-8 encoding.

    May include decimal numeric character references (of the form: &#8364;) to
    access characters in a font beyond position 127. The hexadecimal format
    (like &#xA9;) is supported. Strings in UTF-8 encoding can be passed
    directly.

    Named entities, such as &copy;, are not supported. Consider using 
    |html_entity_decode| to decode these named entities into UTF-8 strings.

    If a character is used in the string which is not supported by the font, a
    hollow rectangle will replace the character.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns an array with 8 elements representing four points making the bounding
box of the text. The order of the points is lower left, lower right, upper
right, upper left. The points are relative to the text regardless of the
angle, so "upper left" means in the top left-hand corner when you see the text
horizontally. Returns FALSE on error.

==============================================================================
*Changelog*

Version                          Description
5.2.0   It is now possible to specify an hexadecimal entity in {text}.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 imagettftext() example

This example script will produce a white PNG 400x30 pixels, with the words
"Testing..." in black (with grey shadow), in the font Arial.

<?php >
    // Set the content-type
    header('Content-Type: image/png');

    // Create the image
    $im = imagecreatetruecolor(400, 30);

    // Create some colors
    $white = imagecolorallocate($im, 255, 255, 255);
    $grey = imagecolorallocate($im, 128, 128, 128);
    $black = imagecolorallocate($im, 0, 0, 0);
    imagefilledrectangle($im, 0, 0, 399, 29, $white);

    // The text to draw
    $text = 'Testing...';
    // Replace path by your own font path
    $font = 'arial.ttf';

    // Add some shadow to the text
    imagettftext($im, 20, 0, 11, 21, $grey, $font, $text);

    // Add the text
    imagettftext($im, 20, 0, 10, 20, $black, $font, $text);

    // Using imagepng() results in clearer text compared with imagejpeg()
    imagepng($im);
    imagedestroy($im);
<?>

The above example will output something similar to:

*Notes*

    Note: This function is only available if PHP is compiled with freetype
    support (--with-freetype-dir=DIR )
