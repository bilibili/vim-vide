flush

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

flush — Flush system output buffer

==============================================================================
*Description*

    void flush ( void )~

Flushes the system write buffers of PHP and whatever backend PHP is using
(CGI, a web server, etc). This attempts to push current output all the way to
the browser with a few caveats.

flush() may not be able to override the buffering scheme of your web server
and it has no effect on any client-side buffering in the browser. It also
doesn't affect PHP's userspace output buffering mechanism. This means you will
have to call both |ob_flush| and flush() to flush the ob output buffers if you
are using those.

Several servers, especially on Win32, will still buffer the output from your
script until it terminates before transmitting the results to the browser.

Server modules for Apache like mod_gzip may do buffering of their own that
will cause flush() to not result in data being sent immediately to the client.

Even the browser may buffer its input before displaying it. Netscape, for
example, buffers text until it receives an end-of-line or the beginning of a
tag, and it won't render tables until the </table> tag of the outermost table
is seen.

Some versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer will only start to display the
page after they have received 256 bytes of output, so you may need to send
extra whitespace before flushing to get those browsers to display the page.
