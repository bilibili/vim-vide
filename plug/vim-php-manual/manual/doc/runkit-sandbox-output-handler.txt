runkit_sandbox_output_handler

(PECL runkit >= 0.7.0)

runkit_sandbox_output_handler — Specify a function to capture and/or process
output from a runkit sandbox

==============================================================================
*Description*

    mixed runkit_sandbox_output_handler ( object $sandbox [, mixed $callback~
    ] )~

Ordinarily, anything output (such as with |echo| or |print|) will be output as
though it were printed from the parent's scope. Using 
runkit_sandbox_output_handler() however, output generated by the sandbox
(including errors), can be captured by a function outside of the sandbox.

    Note: Sandbox support (required for |runkit_lint|, |runkit_lint_file|, and
    the Runkit_Sandbox class) is only available as of PHP 5.1.0 or specially
    patched versions of PHP 5.0, and requires that thread safety be enabled.
    See the README file included in the runkit package for more information.

    Note: Deprecated

    As of runkit version 0.5, this function is deprecated and is scheduled to
    be removed from the package prior to a 1.0 release. The output handler for
    a given Runkit_Sandbox instance may be read/set using the array offset
    syntax shown on the Runkit_Sandbox class definition page.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{sandbox}

    Object instance of Runkit_Sandbox class on which to set output handling.

{callback}

    Name of a function which expects one parameter. Output generated by
    {sandbox} will be passed to this callback. Anything returned by the
    callback will be displayed normally. If this parameter is not passed then
    output handling will not be changed. If a non-truth value is passed,
    output handling will be disabled and will revert to direct display.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns the name of the previously defined output handler callback, or FALSE
if no handler was previously defined.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 Feeding output to a variable

<?php >
    function capture_output($str) {
      $GLOBALS['sandbox_output'] .= $str;

      return '';
    }

    $sandbox_output = '';

    $php = new Runkit_Sandbox();
    runkit_sandbox_output_handler($php, 'capture_output');
    $php->echo("Hello\n");
    $php->eval('var_dump("Excuse me");');
    $php->die("I lost myself.");
    unset($php);

    echo "Sandbox Complete\n\n";
    echo $sandbox_output;
<?>

The above example will output:

Sandbox Complete

Hello
string(9) "Excuse me"
I lost myself.
