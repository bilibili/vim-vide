(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

ldap_search — Search LDAP tree

==============================================================================
*Description*

    resource ldap_search ( resource $link_identifier , string $base_dn ,~
    string $filter [, array $attributes [, int $attrsonly [, int $sizelimit~
    [, int $timelimit [, int $deref ]]]]] )~

Performs the search for a specified filter on the directory with the scope of
LDAP_SCOPE_SUBTREE. This is equivalent to searching the entire directory.

From 4.0.5 on it's also possible to do parallel searches. To do this you use
an array of link identifiers, rather than a single identifier, as the first
argument. If you don't want the same base DN and the same filter for all the
searches, you can also use an array of base DNs and/or an array of filters.
Those arrays must be of the same size as the link identifier array since the
first entries of the arrays are used for one search, the second entries are
used for another, and so on. When doing parallel searches an array of search
result identifiers is returned, except in case of error, then the entry
corresponding to the search will be FALSE. This is very much like the value
normally returned, except that a result identifier is always returned when a
search was made. There are some rare cases where the normal search returns
FALSE while the parallel search returns an identifier.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{link_identifier}

    An LDAP link identifier, returned by |ldap_connect|.

{base_dn}

    The base DN for the directory.

{filter}

    The search filter can be simple or advanced, using boolean operators in
    the format described in the LDAP documentation (see the >> Netscape
    Directory SDK or >> RFC4515 for full information on filters).

{attributes}

    An array of the required attributes, e.g. array("mail", "sn", "cn"). Note
    that the "dn" is always returned irrespective of which attributes types
    are requested.

    Using this parameter is much more efficient than the default action (which
    is to return all attributes and their associated values). The use of this
    parameter should therefore be considered good practice.

{attrsonly}

    Should be set to 1 if only attribute types are wanted. If set to 0 both
    attributes types and attribute values are fetched which is the default
    behaviour.

{sizelimit}

    Enables you to limit the count of entries fetched. Setting this to 0 means
    no limit.

        Note:

        This parameter can NOT override server-side preset sizelimit. You can
        set it lower though.

        Some directory server hosts will be configured to return no more than
        a preset number of entries. If this occurs, the server will indicate
        that it has only returned a partial results set. This also occurs if
        you use this parameter to limit the count of fetched entries.

{timelimit}

    Sets the number of seconds how long is spend on the search. Setting this
    to 0 means no limit.

        Note:

        This parameter can NOT override server-side preset timelimit. You can
        set it lower though.

{deref}

    Specifies how aliases should be handled during the search. It can be one
    of the following:
      + LDAP_DEREF_NEVER - (default) aliases are never dereferenced.
      + LDAP_DEREF_SEARCHING - aliases should be dereferenced during the
        search but not when locating the base object of the search.
      + LDAP_DEREF_FINDING - aliases should be dereferenced when locating the
        base object but not during the search.
      + LDAP_DEREF_ALWAYS - aliases should be dereferenced always.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns a search result identifier or FALSE on error.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

The example below retrieves the organizational unit, surname, given name and
email address for all people in "My Company" where the surname or given name
contains the substring $person. This example uses a boolean filter to tell the
server to look for information in more than one attribute.

Example #1 LDAP search

<?php >
    // $ds is a valid link identifier for a directory server

    // $person is all or part of a person's name, eg "Jo"

    $dn = "o=My Company, c=US";
    $filter="(|(sn=$person*)(givenname=$person*))";
    $justthese = array("ou", "sn", "givenname", "mail");

    $sr=ldap_search($ds, $dn, $filter, $justthese);

    $info = ldap_get_entries($ds, $sr);

    echo $info["count"]." entries returned\n";
