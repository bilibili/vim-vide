assert

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

assert — Checks if assertion is FALSE

==============================================================================
*Description*

PHP 5 and 7

    bool assert ( mixed $assertion [, string $description ] )~

PHP 7

    bool assert ( mixed $assertion [, Throwable $exception ] )~

assert() will check the given {assertion} and take appropriate action if its
result is FALSE.

Traditional assertions (PHP 5 and 7)

If the {assertion} is given as a string it will be evaluated as PHP code by 
assert(). The advantages of a string {assertion} are less overhead when
assertion checking is off and messages containing the {assertion} expression
when an assertion fails. This means that if you pass a boolean condition as
{assertion} this condition will not show up as parameter to the assertion
function which you may have defined with the |assert_options| function, the
condition is converted to a string before calling that handler function, and
the boolean FALSE is converted as the empty string.

Assertions should be used as a debugging feature only. You may use them for
sanity-checks that test for conditions that should always be TRUE and that
indicate some programming errors if not or to check for the presence of
certain features like extension functions or certain system limits and
features.

Assertions should not be used for normal runtime operations like input
parameter checks. As a rule of thumb your code should always be able to work
correctly if assertion checking is not activated.

The behavior of assert() may be configured by |assert_options| or by
.ini-settings described in that functions manual page.

The |assert_options| function and/or ASSERT_CALLBACK configuration directive
allow a callback function to be set to handle failed assertions.

assert() callbacks are particularly useful for building automated test suites
because they allow you to easily capture the code passed to the assertion,
along with information on where the assertion was made. While this information
can be captured via other methods, using assertions makes it much faster and
easier!

The callback function should accept three arguments. The first argument will
contain the file the assertion failed in. The second argument will contain the
line the assertion failed on and the third argument will contain the
expression that failed (if any — literal values such as 1 or "two" will not be
passed via this argument). Users of PHP 5.4.8 and later may also provide a
fourth optional argument, which will contain the {description} given to assert
(), if it was set.

Expectations (PHP 7 only)

assert() is a language construct in PHP 7, allowing for the definition of
expectations: assertions that take effect in development and testing
environments, but are optimised away to have zero cost in production.

While |assert_options| can still be used to control behaviour as described
above for backward compatibility reasons, PHP 7 only code should use the two
new configuration directives to control the behaviour of assert() and not call
|assert_options|.

                 PHP 7 configuration directives for assert()
   Directive     Default                    Possible values
                  value
                           * 1: generate and execute code (development mode)
zend.assertions  1         * 0: generate code but jump around it at runtime
                           * -1: do not generate code (production mode)

                           * 1: throw when the assertion fails, either by
                             throwing the object provided as the {exception}
                             or by throwing a new AssertionError object if
assert.exception 0           {exception} wasn't provided
                           * 0: use or generate a Throwable as described
                             above, but only generate a warning based on that
                             object rather than throwing it (compatible with
                             PHP 5 behaviour)

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{assertion}

    The assertion. In PHP 5, this must be either a string to be evaluated or a
    boolean to be tested. In PHP 7, this may also be any expression that
    returns a value, which will be executed and the result used to indicate
    whether the assertion succeeded or failed.

{description}

    An optional description that will be included in the failure message if
    the {assertion} fails.

{exception}

    In PHP 7, the second parameter can be a Throwable object instead of a
    descriptive string, in which case this is the object that will be thrown
    if the assertion fails and the assert.exception configuration directive is
    enabled.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

FALSE if the assertion is false, TRUE otherwise.

*Changelog*

Version                              Description
        assert() is now a language construct and not a function. assertion()
7.0.0   can now be an expression. The second parameter is now interpreted
        either as an {exception} (if a Throwable object is given), or as the
        {description} supported from PHP 5.4.8 onwards.
        The {description} parameter was added. The {description} is also now
5.4.8   provided to a callback function in ASSERT_CALLBACK mode as the fourth
        argument.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Traditional assertions (PHP 5 and 7)

Example #1 Handle a failed assertion with a custom handler

<?php >
    // Active assert and make it quiet
    assert_options(ASSERT_ACTIVE, 1);
    assert_options(ASSERT_WARNING, 0);
    assert_options(ASSERT_QUIET_EVAL, 1);

    // Create a handler function
    function my_assert_handler($file, $line, $code)
    {
        echo "<hr>Assertion Failed:
            File '$file'<br />
            Line '$line'<br />
            Code '$code'<br /><hr />";
    }

    // Set up the callback
    assert_options(ASSERT_CALLBACK, 'my_assert_handler');

    // Make an assertion that should fail
    assert('mysql_query("")');
<?>

Example #2 Using a custom handler to print a description

<?php >
    // Active assert and make it quiet
    assert_options(ASSERT_ACTIVE, 1);
    assert_options(ASSERT_WARNING, 0);
    assert_options(ASSERT_QUIET_EVAL, 1);

    // Create a handler function
    function my_assert_handler($file, $line, $code, $desc = null)
    {
        echo "Assertion failed at $file:$line: $code";
        if ($desc) {
            echo ": $desc";
        }
        echo "\n";
    }

    // Set up the callback
    assert_options(ASSERT_CALLBACK, 'my_assert_handler');

    // Make an assertion that should fail
    assert('2 < 1');
    assert('2 < 1', 'Two is less than one');
<?>

The above example will output:

 Assertion failed at test.php:21: 2 < 1
 Assertion failed at test.php:22: 2 < 1: Two is less than one


Expectations (PHP 7 only)

Example #3 Expectations without a custom exception

<?php >
    assert(true == false);
    echo 'Hi!';
<?>

With zend.assertions set to 0, the above example will output:

Hi!

With zend.assertions set to 1 and assert.exception set to 0, the above example
will output:

Warning: assert(): assert(true == false) failed in - on line 2
Hi!

With zend.assertions set to 1 and assert.exception set to 1, the above example
will output:

Fatal error: Uncaught AssertionError: assert(true == false) in -:2
Stack trace:
#0 -(2): assert(false, 'assert(true == ...')
#1 {main}
  thrown in - on line 2

Example #4 Expectations with a custom exception

<?php >
    class CustomError extends AssertionError {}

    assert(true == false, new CustomError('True is not false!'));
    echo 'Hi!';
<?>

With zend.assertions set to 0, the above example will output:

Hi!

With zend.assertions set to 1 and assert.exception set to 0, the above example
will output:

Warning: assert(): CustomError: True is not false! in -:4
Stack trace:
#0 {main} failed in - on line 4
Hi!

With zend.assertions set to 1 and assert.exception set to 1, the above example
will output:

Fatal error: Uncaught CustomError: True is not false! in -:4
Stack trace:
#0 {main}
  thrown in - on line 4
