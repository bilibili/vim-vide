dbx_query — Send a query and fetch all results (if any)

==============================================================================
*Description*

    mixed dbx_query ( object $link_identifier , string $sql_statement [, int~
    $flags ] )~

Sends a query and fetch all results.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{link_identifier}

    The DBX link object returned by |dbx_connect|

{sql_statement}

    SQL statement.

    Data inside the query should be |properly escaped|.

{flags}

    The {flags} parameter is used to control the amount of information that is
    returned. It may be any combination of the following constants with the
    bitwise OR operator (|). The DBX_COLNAMES_* flags override the
    dbx.colnames_case setting from php.ini.

    DBX_RESULT_INDEX
        It is always set, that is, the returned object has a data property
        which is a 2 dimensional array indexed numerically. For example, in
        the expression data[2][3] 2 stands for the row (or record) number and
        3 stands for the column (or field) number. The first row and column
        are indexed at 0. If DBX_RESULT_ASSOC is also specified, the returning
        object contains the information related to DBX_RESULT_INFO too, even
        if it was not specified.
    DBX_RESULT_INFO
        It provides info about columns, such as field names and field types.
    DBX_RESULT_ASSOC
        It effects that the field values can be accessed with the respective
        column names used as keys to the returned object's data property. 
        Associated results are actually references to the numerically indexed
        data, so modifying data[0][0] causes that data[0]
        ['field_name_for_first_column'] is modified as well.
    DBX_RESULT_UNBUFFERED
        This flag will not create the data property, and the rows property
        will initially be 0. Use this flag for large datasets, and use 
        |dbx_fetch_row| to retrieve the results row by row. The |dbx_fetch_row|
        function will return rows that are conformant to the flags set with
        this query. Incidentally, it will also update the rows each time it is
        called.
    DBX_COLNAMES_UNCHANGED
        The case of the returned column names will not be changed.
    DBX_COLNAMES_UPPERCASE
        The case of the returned column names will be changed to uppercase.
    DBX_COLNAMES_LOWERCASE
        The case of the returned column names will be changed to lowercase.

    Note that DBX_RESULT_INDEX is always used, regardless of the actual value
    of {flags} parameter. This means that only the following combinations are
    effective:
      + DBX_RESULT_INDEX
      + DBX_RESULT_INDEX | DBX_RESULT_INFO
      + DBX_RESULT_INDEX | DBX_RESULT_INFO | DBX_RESULT_ASSOC - this is the
        default, if {flags} is not specified.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

dbx_query() returns an object or 1 on success, and 0 on failure. The result
object is returned only if the query given in {sql_statement} produces a
result set (i.e. a SELECT query, even if the result set is empty).

The returned object has four or five properties depending on {flags}:

handle

    It is a valid handle for the connected database, and as such it can be
    used in module specific functions (if required).
    <?php >
    $result = dbx_query($link, "SELECT id FROM table");
    mysql_field_len($result->handle, 0);
<    ?>

cols and rows

    These contain the number of columns (or fields) and rows (or records)
    respectively.
    <?php >
    $result = dbx_query($link, 'SELECT id FROM table');
    echo $result->rows; // number of records
    echo $result->cols; // number of fields 
<    ?>

info (optional)
    It is returned only if either DBX_RESULT_INFO or DBX_RESULT_ASSOC is
    specified in the {flags} parameter. It is a 2 dimensional array, that has
    two named rows (name and type) to retrieve column information.
   
    Example #1 lists each field's name and type

    <?php >
    $result = dbx_query($link, 'SELECT id FROM table',
                         DBX_RESULT_INDEX | DBX_RESULT_INFO);

    for ($i = 0; $i < $result->cols; $i++ ) {
        echo $result->info['name'][$i] . "\n";
        echo $result->info['type'][$i] . "\n";  
    }
<    ?>
data
    This property contains the actual resulting data, possibly associated with
    column names as well depending on {flags}. If DBX_RESULT_ASSOC is set, it
    is possible to use $result->data[2]["field_name"].
   
    Example #2 outputs the content of data property into HTML table

    <?php >
    $result = dbx_query($link, 'SELECT id, parentid, description FROM table');

    echo "<table>\n";
    foreach ($result->data as $row) {
        echo "<tr>\n";
        foreach ($row as $field) {
            echo "<td>$field</td>";
        }
        echo "</tr>\n";
    }
    echo "</table>\n";
<    ?>
   
    Example #3 How to handle UNBUFFERED queries

    <?php >

    $result = dbx_query ($link, 'SELECT id, parentid, description FROM table'
    , DBX_RESULT_UNBUFFERED);

    echo "<table>\n";
    while ($row = dbx_fetch_row($result)) {
        echo "<tr>\n";
        foreach ($row as $field) {
            echo "<td>$field</td>";
        }
        echo "</tr>\n";
    }
    echo "</table>\n";

*Examples*

Example #4 How to handle the returned value

<?php >
    $link   = dbx_connect(DBX_ODBC, "", "db", "username", "password")
        or die("Could not connect");

    $result = dbx_query($link, 'SELECT id, parentid, description FROM table');

    if (is_object($result) ) {
        // ... do some stuff here, see detailed examples below ...
        // first, print out field names and types 
        // then, draw a table filled with the returned field values
    } else {
        exit("Query failed");
    }

    dbx_close($link);

    Note:

    Always refer to the module-specific documentation as well.

    Column names for queries on an Oracle database are returned in lowercase.
