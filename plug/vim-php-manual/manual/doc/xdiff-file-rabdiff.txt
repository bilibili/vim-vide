(PECL xdiff >= 1.5.0)

xdiff_file_rabdiff — Make binary diff of two files using the Rabin's
polynomial fingerprinting algorithm

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool xdiff_file_rabdiff ( string $old_file , string $new_file , string~
    $dest )~

Makes a binary diff of two files and stores the result in a patch file. The
difference between this function and |xdiff_file_bdiff| is different algorithm
used which should result in faster execution and smaller diff produced. This
function works with both text and binary files. Resulting patch file can be
later applied using |xdiff_file_bpatch|/|xdiff_string_bpatch|.

For more details about differences between algorithm used please check >>
 libxdiff website.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{old_file}

    Path to the first file. This file acts as "old" file.

{new_file}

    Path to the second file. This file acts as "new" file.

{dest}

    Path of the resulting patch file. Resulting file contains differences
    between "old" and "new" files. It is in binary format and is
    human-unreadable.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 xdiff_file_rabdiff() example

The following code makes binary diff of two archives.

<?php >
    $old_version = 'my_script_1.0.tgz';
    $new_version = 'my_script_1.1.tgz';

    xdiff_file_rabdiff($old_version, $new_version, 'my_script.bdiff');
<?>

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    Both files will be loaded into memory so ensure that your memory_limit is
    set high enough.
