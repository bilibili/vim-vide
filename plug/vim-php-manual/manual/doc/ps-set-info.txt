*Description*

    bool ps_set_info ( resource $p , string $key , string $val )~

Sets certain information fields of the document. This fields will be shown as
a comment in the header of the PostScript file. If the document is converted
to pdf this fields will also be used for the document information.

The BoundingBox is usually set to the value given to the first page. This only
works if |ps_findfont| has not been called before. In such cases the
BoundingBox would be left unset unless you set it explicitly with this
function.

This function will have no effect anymore when the header of the postscript
file has been already written. It must be called before the first page or the
first call of |ps_findfont|.

{value}

    right corner.

        Note:

        Up to version 0.2.6 of pslib, the BoundingBox and Orientation will be
        overwritten by |ps_begin_page|, unless |ps_findfont| has been called
