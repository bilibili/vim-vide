session_destroy

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

session_destroy — Destroys all data registered to a session

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool session_destroy ( void )~

session_destroy() destroys all of the data associated with the current
session. It does not unset any of the global variables associated with the
session, or unset the session cookie. To use the session variables again, 
|session_start| has to be called.

    Note: You do not have to call session_destroy() from usual code. Cleanup
    $_SESSION array rather than destroying session data.

In order to kill the session altogether, the session ID must also be unset. If
a cookie is used to propagate the session ID (default behavior), then the
session cookie must be deleted. |setcookie| may be used for that.

When session.use_strict_mode is enabled. You do not have to remove obsolete
session ID cookie because session module will not accept session ID cookie
when there is no data associated to the session ID and set new session ID
cookie. Enabling session.use_strict_mode is recommended for all sites.

Warning

Immediate session deletion may cause unwanted results. When there is
concurrent requests, other connections may see sudden session data loss. e.g.
Requests from JavaScript and/or requests from URL links.

Although current session module does not accept empty session ID cookie, but
immediate session deletion may result in empty session ID cookie due to client
(browser) side race condition. This will result that the client creates many
session ID needlessly.

To avoid these, you must set deletion time-stamp to $_SESSION and reject
access while later. Or make sure your application does not have concurrent
requests. This applies to |session_regenerate_id| also.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

*Examples*

Example #1 Destroying a session with $_SESSION

<?php >
    // Initialize the session.
    // If you are using session_name("something"), don't forget it now!
    session_start();

    // Unset all of the session variables.
    $_SESSION = array();

    // If it's desired to kill the session, also delete the session cookie.
    // Note: This will destroy the session, and not just the session data!
    if (ini_get("session.use_cookies")) {
        $params = session_get_cookie_params();
        setcookie(session_name(), '', time() - 42000,
            $params["path"], $params["domain"],
            $params["secure"], $params["httponly"]
        );
    }

    // Finally, destroy the session.
    session_destroy();
<?>

*Notes*

    Note:

    Only use |session_unset| for older deprecated code that does not use
    $_SESSION.
