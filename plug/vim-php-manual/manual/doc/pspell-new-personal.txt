pspell_new_personal — Load a new dictionary with personal wordlist

==============================================================================
*Description*

    int pspell_new_personal ( string $personal , string $language [, string~
    $spelling [, string $jargon [, string $encoding [, int $mode = 0 ]]]] )~

pspell_new_personal() opens up a new dictionary with a personal wordlist. The
wordlist can be modified and saved with |pspell_save_wordlist|, if desired.
However, the replacement pairs are not saved. In order to save replacement
pairs, you should create a config using |pspell_config_create|, set the
personal wordlist file with |pspell_config_personal|, set the file for
replacement pairs with |pspell_config_repl|, and open a new dictionary with 
|pspell_new_config|.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{personal}

    The file where words added to the personal list will be stored. It should
    be an absolute filename beginning with '/' because otherwise it will be
    relative to $HOME, which is "/root" for most systems, and is probably not
    what you want.

{language}

    The language code which consists of the two letter ISO 639 language code
    and an optional two letter ISO 3166 country code after a dash or
    underscore.

{spelling}

    The requested spelling for languages with more than one spelling such as
    English. Known values are 'american', 'british', and 'canadian'.

{jargon}

    Extra information to distinguish two different words lists that have the
    same language and spelling parameters.

{encoding}

    The encoding that words are expected to be in. Valid values are utf-8,
    iso8859-*, koi8-r, viscii, cp1252, machine unsigned 16, machine unsigned
    32.

{mode}

    The mode in which spellchecker will work. There are several modes
    available:
      + PSPELL_FAST - Fast mode (least number of suggestions)
      + PSPELL_NORMAL - Normal mode (more suggestions)
      + PSPELL_BAD_SPELLERS - Slow mode (a lot of suggestions)
      + PSPELL_RUN_TOGETHER - Consider run-together words as legal compounds.
        That is, "thecat" will be a legal compound, although there should be a
        space between the two words. Changing this setting only affects the
        results returned by |pspell_check|; |pspell_suggest| will still return
        suggestions.
    Mode is a bitmask constructed from different constants listed above.
    However, PSPELL_FAST, PSPELL_NORMAL and PSPELL_BAD_SPELLERS are mutually
    exclusive, so you should select only one of them.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns the dictionary link identifier for use in other pspell functions.
