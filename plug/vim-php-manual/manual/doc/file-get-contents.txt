file_get_contents

(PHP 4 >= 4.3.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

file_get_contents — Reads entire file into a string

==============================================================================
*Description*

    string file_get_contents ( string $filename [, bool $use_include_path =~
    false [, resource $context [, int $offset = 0 [, int $maxlen ]]]] )~

This function is similar to |file|, except that file_get_contents() returns
the file in a string, starting at the specified {offset} up to {maxlen} bytes.
On failure, file_get_contents() will return FALSE.

file_get_contents() is the preferred way to read the contents of a file into a
string. It will use memory mapping techniques if supported by your OS to
enhance performance.

    Note:

    If you're opening a URI with special characters, such as spaces, you need
    to encode the URI with |urlencode|.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{filename}

    Name of the file to read.

{use_include_path}


        Note:

        As of PHP 5 the FILE_USE_INCLUDE_PATH constant can be used to trigger
        include path search.

{context}

    A valid context resource created with |stream_context_create|. If you
    don't need to use a custom context, you can skip this parameter by NULL.

{offset}

    The offset where the reading starts on the original stream. Negative
    offsets count from the end of the stream.

    Seeking ({offset}) is not supported with remote files. Attempting to seek
    on non-local files may work with small offsets, but this is unpredictable
    because it works on the buffered stream.

{maxlen}

    Maximum length of data read. The default is to read until end of file is
    reached. Note that this parameter is applied to the stream processed by
    the filters.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

The function returns the read data or FALSE on failure.

Warning

This function may return Boolean FALSE, but may also return a non-Boolean
value which evaluates to FALSE. Please read the section on Booleans for more
information. Use the === operator for testing the return value of this
function.

==============================================================================
*Errors/Exceptions*

An E_WARNING level error is generated if {filename} cannot be found,
{maxlength} is less than zero, or if seeking to the specified {offset} in the
stream fails.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 Get and output the source of the homepage of a website

<?php >
    $homepage = file_get_contents('http://www.example.com/');
    echo $homepage;
<?>

Example #2 Searching within the include_path

<?php >
    // <= PHP 5
    $file = file_get_contents('./people.txt', true);
    // > PHP 5
    $file = file_get_contents('./people.txt', FILE_USE_INCLUDE_PATH);
<?>

Example #3 Reading a section of a file

<?php >
    // Read 14 characters starting from the 21st character
    $section = file_get_contents('./people.txt', NULL, NULL, 20, 14);
    var_dump($section);
<?>

The above example will output something similar to:

string(14) "lle Bjori Ro"

Example #4 Using stream contexts

<?php >
    // Create a stream
    $opts = array(
      'http'=>array(
        'method'=>"GET",
        'header'=>"Accept-language: en\r\n" .
                  "Cookie: foo=bar\r\n"
      )
    );

    $context = stream_context_create($opts);

    // Open the file using the HTTP headers set above
    $file = file_get_contents('http://www.example.com/', false, $context);
<?>

==============================================================================
*Changelog*

Version                  Description
7.1.0   Support for negative {offset}s has been added.
5.1.0   Added the {offset} and {maxlen} parameters.

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note: This function is binary-safe.

Tip

A URL can be used as a filename with this function if the fopen wrappers have
been enabled. See |fopen| for more details on how to specify the filename. See
the Supported Protocols and Wrappers for links to information about what
abilities the various wrappers have, notes on their usage, and information on
any predefined variables they may provide.

Warning

When using SSL, Microsoft IIS will violate the protocol by closing the
connection without sending a close_notify indicator. PHP will report this as
"SSL: Fatal Protocol Error" when you reach the end of the data. To work around
this, the value of error_reporting should be lowered to a level that does not
include warnings. PHP can detect buggy IIS server software when you open the
stream using the https:// wrapper and will suppress the warning. When using 
|fsockopen| to create an ssl:// socket, the developer is responsible for
detecting and suppressing this warning.
