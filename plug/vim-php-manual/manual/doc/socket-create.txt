socket_create — Create a socket (endpoint for communication)

==============================================================================
*Description*

    resource socket_create ( int $domain , int $type , int $protocol )~

Creates and returns a socket resource, also referred to as an endpoint of
communication. A typical network connection is made up of 2 sockets, one
performing the role of the client, and another performing the role of the
server.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{domain}

    The {domain} parameter specifies the protocol family to be used by the
    socket.

                     Available address/protocol families
     Domain                             Description
    AF_INET  IPv4 Internet based protocols. TCP and UDP are common protocols
             of this protocol family.
    AF_INET6 IPv6 Internet based protocols. TCP and UDP are common protocols
             of this protocol family.
             Local communication protocol family. High efficiency and low
    AF_UNIX  overhead make it a great form of IPC (Interprocess
             Communication).

{type}

    The {type} parameter selects the type of communication to be used by the
    socket.

                            Available socket types
         Type                              Description
                   Provides sequenced, reliable, full-duplex, connection-based
    SOCK_STREAM    byte streams. An out-of-band data transmission mechanism
                   may be supported. The TCP protocol is based on this socket
                   type.
                   Supports datagrams (connectionless, unreliable messages of
    SOCK_DGRAM     a fixed maximum length). The UDP protocol is based on this
                   socket type.
                   Provides a sequenced, reliable, two-way connection-based
    SOCK_SEQPACKET data transmission path for datagrams of fixed maximum
                   length; a consumer is required to read an entire packet
                   with each read call.
                   Provides raw network protocol access. This special type of
    SOCK_RAW       socket can be used to manually construct any type of
                   protocol. A common use for this socket type is to perform
                   ICMP requests (like ping).
                   Provides a reliable datagram layer that does not guarantee
    SOCK_RDM       ordering. This is most likely not implemented on your
                   operating system.

{protocol}

    The {protocol} parameter sets the specific protocol within the specified
    {domain} to be used when communicating on the returned socket. The proper
    value can be retrieved by name by using |getprotobyname|. If the desired
    protocol is TCP, or UDP the corresponding constants SOL_TCP, and SOL_UDP
    can also be used.

                               Common protocols
    Name                              Description
         The Internet Control Message Protocol is used primarily by gateways
    icmp and hosts to report errors in datagram communication. The "ping"
         command (present in most modern operating systems) is an example
         application of ICMP.
         The User Datagram Protocol is a connectionless, unreliable, protocol
    udp  with fixed record lengths. Due to these aspects, UDP requires a
         minimum amount of protocol overhead.
         The Transmission Control Protocol is a reliable, connection based,
         stream oriented, full duplex protocol. TCP guarantees that all data
         packets will be received in the order in which they were sent. If any
         packet is somehow lost during communication, TCP will automatically
    tcp  retransmit the packet until the destination host acknowledges that
         packet. For reliability and performance reasons, the TCP
         implementation itself decides the appropriate octet boundaries of the
         underlying datagram communication layer. Therefore, TCP applications
         must allow for the possibility of partial record transmission.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

socket_create() returns a socket resource on success, or FALSE on error. The
actual error code can be retrieved by calling |socket_last_error|. This error
code may be passed to |socket_strerror| to get a textual explanation of the
error.

==============================================================================
*Errors/Exceptions*

If an invalid {domain} or {type} is given, socket_create() defaults to AF_INET
and SOCK_STREAM respectively and additionally emits an E_WARNING message.
