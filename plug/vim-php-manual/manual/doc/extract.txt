extract

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

extract — Import variables into the current symbol table from an array

==============================================================================
*Description*

    int extract ( array &$array [, int $flags = EXTR_OVERWRITE [, string~
    $prefix = NULL ]] )~

Import variables from an array into the current symbol table.

Checks each key to see whether it has a valid variable name. It also checks
for collisions with existing variables in the symbol table.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{array}

    An associative array. This function treats keys as variable names and
    values as variable values. For each key/value pair it will create a
    variable in the current symbol table, subject to {flags} and {prefix}
    parameters.

    You must use an associative array; a numerically indexed array will not
    produce results unless you use EXTR_PREFIX_ALL or EXTR_PREFIX_INVALID.

{flags}

    The way invalid/numeric keys and collisions are treated is determined by
    the extraction {flags}. It can be one of the following values:

    EXTR_OVERWRITE
        If there is a collision, overwrite the existing variable.
    EXTR_SKIP
        If there is a collision, don't overwrite the existing variable.
    EXTR_PREFIX_SAME
        If there is a collision, prefix the variable name with {prefix}.
    EXTR_PREFIX_ALL
        Prefix all variable names with {prefix}.
    EXTR_PREFIX_INVALID
        Only prefix invalid/numeric variable names with {prefix}.
    EXTR_IF_EXISTS
        Only overwrite the variable if it already exists in the current symbol
        table, otherwise do nothing. This is useful for defining a list of
        valid variables and then extracting only those variables you have
        defined out of $_REQUEST, for example.
    EXTR_PREFIX_IF_EXISTS
        Only create prefixed variable names if the non-prefixed version of the
        same variable exists in the current symbol table.
    EXTR_REFS
        Extracts variables as references. This effectively means that the
        values of the imported variables are still referencing the values of
        the {array} parameter. You can use this flag on its own or combine it
        with any other flag by OR'ing the {flags}.

    If {flags} is not specified, it is assumed to be EXTR_OVERWRITE.

{prefix}

    Note that {prefix} is only required if {flags} is EXTR_PREFIX_SAME,
    EXTR_PREFIX_ALL, EXTR_PREFIX_INVALID or EXTR_PREFIX_IF_EXISTS. If the
    prefixed result is not a valid variable name, it is not imported into the
    symbol table. Prefixes are automatically separated from the array key by
    an underscore character.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns the number of variables successfully imported into the symbol table.

*Examples*

Example #1 extract() example

A possible use for extract() is to import into the symbol table variables
contained in an associative array returned by |wddx_deserialize|.

<?php >

    /* Suppose that $var_array is an array returned from
       wddx_deserialize */

    $size = "large";
    $var_array = array("color" => "blue",
                       "size"  => "medium",
                       "shape" => "sphere");
    extract($var_array, EXTR_PREFIX_SAME, "wddx");

    echo "$color, $size, $shape, $wddx_size\n";

<?>

The above example will output:

blue, large, sphere, medium

The $size wasn't overwritten because we specified EXTR_PREFIX_SAME, which
resulted in $wddx_size being created. If EXTR_SKIP was specified, then
$wddx_size wouldn't even have been created. EXTR_OVERWRITE would have caused
$size to have value "medium", and EXTR_PREFIX_ALL would result in new
variables being named $wddx_color, $wddx_size, and $wddx_shape.

*Notes*

Warning

Do not use extract() on untrusted data, like user input (i.e. $_GET, $_FILES,
etc.). If you do, for example if you want to temporarily run old code that
relied on register_globals, make sure you use one of the non-overwriting
{flags} values such as EXTR_SKIP and be aware that you should extract in the
same order that's defined in variables_order within the php.ini.

    Note:

    If you still have register_globals and it is turned on, if you use extract
    () on $_FILES and specify EXTR_SKIP, you may be surprised at the results.

    Warning

    This is not recommended practice and is only documented here for
    completeness. The use of register_globals is deprecated and calling 
    extract() on untrusted data such as $_FILES is, as noted above, a
    potential security risk. If you encounter this issue, it means that you
    are using at least two poor coding practices.

    <?php >

    /* Suppose that $testfile is the name of a file upload input
       and that register_globals is turned on. */

    var_dump($testfile);
    extract($_FILES, EXTR_SKIP);
    var_dump($testfile);
    var_dump($testfile['tmp_name']);

<    ?>
    You might expect to see something like the following:

    string(14) "/tmp/phpgCCPX8"
    array(5) {
      ["name"]=>
      string(10) "somefile.txt"
      ["type"]=>
      string(24) "application/octet-stream"
      ["tmp_name"]=>
      string(14) "/tmp/phpgCCPX8"
      ["error"]=>
      int(0)
      ["size"]=>
      int(4208)
    }
    string(14) "/tmp/phpgCCPX8"

    However, you would instead see something like this:

    string(14) "/tmp/phpgCCPX8"
    string(14) "/tmp/phpgCCPX8"
    string(1) "/"

    This is due to the fact that since register_globals is turned on,
    $testfile already exists in the global scope when extract() is called. And
    since EXTR_SKIP is specified, $testfile is not overwritten with the
    contents of the $_FILES array so $testfile remains a string. Because
    strings may be accessed using array syntax and the non-numeric string
    tmp_name is interpreted as 0, PHP sees $testfile['tmp_name'] as $testfile
    [0].
