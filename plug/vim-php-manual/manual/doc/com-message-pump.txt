com_message_pump

(PHP 4 >= 4.2.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

com_message_pump — Process COM messages, sleeping for up to timeoutms
milliseconds

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool com_message_pump ([ int $timeoutms = 0 ] )~

This function will sleep for up to {timeoutms} milliseconds, or until a
message arrives in the queue.

The purpose of this function is to route COM calls between apartments and
handle various synchronization issues. This allows your script to wait
efficiently for events to be triggered, while still handling other events or
running other code in the background. You should use it in a loop, as
demonstrated by the example in the |com_event_sink| function, until you are
finished using event bound COM objects.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{timeoutms}

    The timeout, in milliseconds.

    If you do not specify a value for {timeoutms}, then 0 will be assumed. A 0
    value means that no waiting will be performed; if there are messages
    pending they will be dispatched as before; if there are no messages
    pending, the function will return FALSE immediately without sleeping.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

If a message or messages arrives before the timeout, they will be dispatched,
and the function will return TRUE. If the timeout occurs and no messages were
processed, the return value will be FALSE.
