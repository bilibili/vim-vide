yaz_connect — Prepares for a connection to a Z39.50 server

==============================================================================
*Description*

    mixed yaz_connect ( string $zurl [, mixed $options ] )~

This function returns a connection resource on success, zero on failure.

yaz_connect() prepares for a connection to a Z39.50 server. This function is
non-blocking and does not attempt to establish a connection - it merely
prepares a connect to be performed later when |yaz_wait| is called.

    Note:

    The >> YAZ proxy is a freely available Z39.50 proxy.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{zurl}

    A string that takes the form host[:port][/database]. If port is omitted,
    port 210 is used. If database is omitted Default is used.

{options}

    If given as a string, it is treated as the Z39.50 V2 authentication string
    (OpenAuth).

    If given as an array, the contents of the array serves as options.

    user

        Username for authentication.

    group

        Group for authentication.

    password

        Password for authentication.

    cookie

        Cookie for session (YAZ proxy).

    proxy

        Proxy for connection (YAZ proxy).

    persistent

        A boolean. If TRUE the connection is persistent; If FALSE the
        connection is not persistent. By default connections are persistent.

            Note:

            If you open a persistent connection, you won't be able to close it
            later with |yaz_close|.

    piggyback

        A boolean. If TRUE piggyback is enabled for searches; If FALSE
        piggyback is disabled. By default piggyback is enabled.

        Enabling piggyback is more efficient and usually saves a
        network-round-trip for first time fetches of records. However, a few
        Z39.50 servers do not support piggyback or they ignore element set
        names. For those, piggyback should be disabled.

    charset

        A string that specifies character set to be used in Z39.50 language
        and character set negotiation. Use strings such as: ISO-8859-1, UTF-8,
        UTF-16.

        Most Z39.50 servers do not support this feature (and thus, this is
        ignored). Many servers use the ISO-8859-1 encoding for queries and
        messages. MARC21/USMARC records are not affected by this setting.

    preferredMessageSize

        An integer that specifies the maximum byte size of all records to be
        returned by a target during retrieval. See the >> Z39.50 standard for
        more information.

            Note:

            This option is supported in PECL YAZ 1.0.5 or later.

    maximumRecordSize

        An integer that specifies the maximum byte size of a single record to
        be returned by a target during retrieval. This entity is referred to
        as Exceptional-record-size in the >> Z39.50 standard.

            Note:

            This option is supported in PECL YAZ 1.0.5 or later.
