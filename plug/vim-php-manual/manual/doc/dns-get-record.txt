dns_get_record

(PHP 5, PHP 7)

dns_get_record — Fetch DNS Resource Records associated with a hostname

==============================================================================
*Description*

    array dns_get_record ( string $hostname [, int $type = DNS_ANY [, array~
    &$authns [, array &$addtl [, bool $raw = false ]]]] )~

Fetch DNS Resource Records associated with the given {hostname}.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{hostname}

    {hostname} should be a valid DNS hostname such as "www.example.com".
    Reverse lookups can be generated using in-addr.arpa notation, but 
    |gethostbyaddr| is more suitable for the majority of reverse lookups.

        Note:

        Per DNS standards, email addresses are given in user.host format (for
        example: hostmaster.example.com as opposed to hostmaster@example.com),
        be sure to check this value and modify if necessary before using it
        with a functions such as |mail|.

{type}

    By default, dns_get_record() will search for any resource records
    associated with {hostname}. To limit the query, specify the optional
    {type} parameter. May be any one of the following: DNS_A, DNS_CNAME,
    DNS_HINFO, DNS_CAA, DNS_MX, DNS_NS, DNS_PTR, DNS_SOA, DNS_TXT, DNS_AAAA,
    DNS_SRV, DNS_NAPTR, DNS_A6, DNS_ALL or DNS_ANY.

        Note:

        Because of eccentricities in the performance of libresolv between
        platforms, DNS_ANY will not always return every record, the slower
        DNS_ALL will collect all records more reliably.

{authns}

    Passed by reference and, if given, will be populated with Resource Records
    for the Authoritative Name Servers.

{addtl}

    Passed by reference and, if given, will be populated with any Additional
    Records.

{raw}

    In case of raw mode, we query only the requested type instead of looping
    type by type before going with the additional info stuff.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

This function returns an array of associative arrays, or FALSE on failure.
Each associative array contains at minimum the following keys:

                             Basic DNS attributes
Attribute                               Meaning
host      The record in the DNS namespace to which the rest of the associated
          data refers.
class     dns_get_record() only returns Internet class records and as such
          this parameter will always return IN.
          String containing the record type. Additional attributes will also
type      be contained in the resulting array dependant on the value of type.
          See table below.
          "Time To Live" remaining for this record. This will not equal the
ttl       record's original ttl, but will rather equal the original ttl minus
          whatever length of time has passed since the authoritative name
          server was queried.

             Other keys in associative arrays dependant on 'type'
 Type                               Extra Columns
A      ip: An IPv4 addresses in dotted decimal notation.
MX     pri: Priority of mail exchanger. Lower numbers indicate greater
       priority. target: FQDN of the mail exchanger. See also |dns_get_mx|.
CNAME  target: FQDN of location in DNS namespace to which the record is
       aliased.
NS     target: FQDN of the name server which is authoritative for this
       hostname.
PTR    target: Location within the DNS namespace to which this record points.
TXT    txt: Arbitrary string data associated with this record.
       cpu: IANA number designating the CPU of the machine referenced by this
HINFO  record. os: IANA number designating the Operating System on the machine
       referenced by this record. See IANA's >> Operating System Names for the
       meaning of these values.
       flags: A one-byte bitfield; currently only bit 0 is defined, meaning
       'critical'; other bits are reserved and should be ignored. tag: The CAA
CAA    tag name (alphanumeric ASCII string). value: The CAA tag value (binary
       string, may use subformats). For additional information see: >> RFC
       6844
       mname: FQDN of the machine from which the resource records originated.
       rname: Email address of the administrative contact for this domain.
       serial: Serial # of this revision of the requested domain. refresh:
       Refresh interval (seconds) secondary name servers should use when
       updating remote copies of this domain. retry: Length of time (seconds)
SOA    to wait after a failed refresh before making a second attempt. expire:
       Maximum length of time (seconds) a secondary DNS server should retain
       remote copies of the zone data without a successful refresh before
       discarding. minimum-ttl: Minimum length of time (seconds) a client can
       continue to use a DNS resolution before it should request a new
       resolution from the server. Can be overridden by individual resource
       records.
AAAA   ipv6: IPv6 address
A6(PHP masklen: Length (in bits) to inherit from the target specified by
>=     {chain}. ipv6: Address for this specific record to merge with {chain}.
5.1.0) chain: Parent record to merge with {ipv6} data.
       pri: (Priority) lowest priorities should be used first. weight: Ranking
SRV    to weight which of commonly prioritized {targets} should be chosen at
       random. target and port: hostname and port where the requested service
       can be found. For additional information see: >> RFC 2782
NAPTR  order and pref: Equivalent to {pri} and {weight} above. flags, services
       , regex, and replacement: Parameters as defined by >> RFC 2915.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 Using dns_get_record()

<?php >
    $result = dns_get_record("php.net");
    print_r($result);
<?>

The above example will output something similar to:

Array
(
    [0] => Array
        (
            [host] => php.net
            [type] => MX
            [pri] => 5
            [target] => pair2.php.net
            [class] => IN
            [ttl] => 6765
        )

    [1] => Array
        (
            [host] => php.net
            [type] => A
            [ip] => 64.246.30.37
            [class] => IN
            [ttl] => 8125
        )

)

Example #2 Using dns_get_record() and DNS_ANY

Since it's very common to want the IP address of a mail server once the MX
record has been resolved, dns_get_record() also returns an array in {addtl}
which contains associate records. {authns} is returned as well containing a
list of authoritative name servers.

<?php >
    /* Request "ANY" record for php.net,
       and create $authns and $addtl arrays
       containing list of name servers and
       any additional records which go with
       them */
    $result = dns_get_record("php.net", DNS_ANY, $authns, $addtl);
    echo "Result = ";
    print_r($result);
    echo "Auth NS = ";
    print_r($authns);
    echo "Additional = ";
    print_r($addtl);
<?>

The above example will output something similar to:
