preg_replace

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

preg_replace — Perform a regular expression search and replace

==============================================================================
*Description*

    mixed preg_replace ( mixed $pattern , mixed $replacement , mixed $subject~
    [, int $limit = -1 [, int &$count ]] )~

Searches {subject} for matches to {pattern} and replaces them with
{replacement}.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{pattern}

    The pattern to search for. It can be either a string or an array with
    strings.

    Several PCRE modifiers are also available.

{replacement}

    The string or an array with strings to replace. If this parameter is a
    string and the {pattern} parameter is an array, all patterns will be
    replaced by that string. If both {pattern} and {replacement} parameters
    are arrays, each {pattern} will be replaced by the {replacement}
    counterpart. If there are fewer elements in the {replacement} array than
    in the {pattern} array, any extra {pattern}s will be replaced by an empty
    string.

    {replacement} may contain references of the form \\n or $n, with the
    latter form being the preferred one. Every such reference will be replaced
    by the text captured by the n'th parenthesized pattern. n can be from 0 to
    99, and \\0 or $0 refers to the text matched by the whole pattern. Opening
    parentheses are counted from left to right (starting from 1) to obtain the
    number of the capturing subpattern. To use backslash in replacement, it
    must be doubled ("\\\\" PHP string).

    When working with a replacement pattern where a backreference is
    immediately followed by another number (i.e.: placing a literal number
    immediately after a matched pattern), you cannot use the familiar \\1
    notation for your backreference. \\11, for example, would confuse 
    preg_replace() since it does not know whether you want the \\1
    backreference followed by a literal 1, or the \\11 backreference followed
    by nothing. In this case the solution is to use ${1}1. This creates an
    isolated $1 backreference, leaving the 1 as a literal.

    When using the deprecated e modifier, this function escapes some
    characters (namely ', ", \ and NULL) in the strings that replace the
    backreferences. This is done to ensure that no syntax errors arise from
    backreference usage with either single or double quotes (e.g. 'strlen(\'$1
    \')+strlen("$2")'). Make sure you are aware of PHP's string syntax to know
    exactly how the interpreted string will look.

{subject}

    The string or an array with strings to search and replace.

    If {subject} is an array, then the search and replace is performed on
    every entry of {subject}, and the return value is an array as well.

{limit}

    The maximum possible replacements for each pattern in each {subject}
    string. Defaults to -1 (no limit).

{count}

    If specified, this variable will be filled with the number of replacements
    done.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

preg_replace() returns an array if the {subject} parameter is an array, or a
string otherwise.

If matches are found, the new {subject} will be returned, otherwise {subject}
will be returned unchanged or NULL if an error occurred.

==============================================================================
*Errors/Exceptions*

As of PHP 5.5.0 E_DEPRECATED level error is emitted when passing in the "\e"
modifier. As of PHP 7.0.0 E_WARNING is emitted in this case and "\e" modifier
has no effect.

==============================================================================
*Changelog*

Version                              Description
7.0.0   Support for the /e modifier has been removed. Use 
        |preg_replace_callback| instead.
        The /e modifier is deprecated. Use |preg_replace_callback| instead.
5.5.0   See the PREG_REPLACE_EVAL documentation for additional information
        about security risks.
5.1.0   Added the {count} parameter

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 Using backreferences followed by numeric literals

<?php >
    $string = 'April 15, 2003';
    $pattern = '/(\w+) (\d+), (\d+)/i';
    $replacement = '${1}1,$3';
    echo preg_replace($pattern, $replacement, $string);
<?>

The above example will output:

April1,2003

Example #2 Using indexed arrays with preg_replace()

<?php >
    $string = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.';
    $patterns = array();
    $patterns[0] = '/quick/';
    $patterns[1] = '/brown/';
    $patterns[2] = '/fox/';
    $replacements = array();
    $replacements[2] = 'bear';
    $replacements[1] = 'black';
    $replacements[0] = 'slow';
    echo preg_replace($patterns, $replacements, $string);
<?>

The above example will output:

The bear black slow jumps over the lazy dog.

By ksorting patterns and replacements, we should get what we wanted.

<?php >
    ksort($patterns);
    ksort($replacements);
    echo preg_replace($patterns, $replacements, $string);
<?>

The above example will output:

The slow black bear jumps over the lazy dog.

Example #3 Replacing several values

<?php >
    $patterns = array ('/(19|20)(\d{2})-(\d{1,2})-(\d{1,2})/',
                       '/^\s*{(\w+)}\s*=/');
    $replace = array ('\3/\4/\1\2', '$\1 =');
    echo preg_replace($patterns, $replace, '{startDate} = 1999-5-27');
<?>

The above example will output:

$startDate = 5/27/1999

Example #4 Strip whitespace

This example strips excess whitespace from a string.

<?php >
    $str = 'foo   o';
    $str = preg_replace('/\s\s+/', ' ', $str);
    // This will be 'foo o' now
    echo $str;
<?>

Example #5 Using the {count} parameter

<?php >
    $count = 0;

    echo preg_replace(array('/\d/', '/\s/'), '*', 'xp 4 to', -1 , $count);
    echo $count; //3
<?>

The above example will output:

xp***to
3

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    When using arrays with {pattern} and {replacement}, the keys are processed
    in the order they appear in the array. This is not necessarily the same as
    the numerical index order. If you use indexes to identify which {pattern}
    should be replaced by which {replacement}, you should perform a |ksort| on
    each array prior to calling preg_replace().
