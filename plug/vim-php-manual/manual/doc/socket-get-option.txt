socket_get_option

(PHP 4 >= 4.3.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

socket_get_option — Gets socket options for the socket

==============================================================================
*Description*

    mixed socket_get_option ( resource $socket , int $level , int $optname )~

The socket_get_option() function retrieves the value for the option specified
by the {optname} parameter for the specified {socket}.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{socket}

    A valid socket resource created with |socket_create| or |socket_accept|.

{level}

    The {level} parameter specifies the protocol level at which the option
    resides. For example, to retrieve options at the socket level, a {level}
    parameter of SOL_SOCKET would be used. Other levels, such as TCP, can be
    used by specifying the protocol number of that level. Protocol numbers can
    be found by using the |getprotobyname| function.

                             connection is broken
                             and processes writing
                             to that socket are
                             notified with a SIGPIPE
                             signal.
                             Reports whether the
                             {socket} lingers on 
                             |socket_close| if data
                             is present. By default,
                             when the socket is
                             closed, it attempts to
                             send all unsent data.
                             In the case of a

                             socket, |socket_close|
                             will wait for its peer
                             to acknowledge the
                             data.

                             If l_onoff is non-zero
                             and l_linger is zero,

                             socket.

                             On the other hand, if
                             l_onoff is non-zero and
                             l_linger is non-zero, 
                             |socket_close| will
                             block until all the
                             data is sent or the

                             l_linger elapses. If
                             the socket is
                             non-blocking, 
                             |socket_close| will fail
                             and return an error.

    IP_MULTICAST_TTL         (don't leave the        int between 0 and 255.
                             interface) and 255. The
                             default value is 1
                             (only the local network
                             is reached). (added in
                             PHP 5.4)
                             Analogous to
                             IP_MULTICAST_TTL, but
                             for IPv6 packets. The
    IPV6_MULTICAST_HOPS      value -1 is also        int between -1 and 255.
                             accepted, meaning the
                             route default should be
                             used. (added in PHP
                             5.4)
