sqlsrv_connect — Opens a connection to a Microsoft SQL Server database

==============================================================================
*Description*

    resource sqlsrv_connect ( string $serverName [, array $connectionInfo ] )~

Opens a connection to a Microsoft SQL Server database. By default, the
connection is attempted using Windows Authentication. To connect using SQL
Server Authentication, include "UID" and "PWD" in the connection options
array.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{serverName}

    The name of the server to which a connection is established. To connect to
    a specific instance, follow the server name with a backward slash and the
    instance name (e.g. serverName\sqlexpress).

{connectionInfo}

    An associative array that specifies options for connecting to the server.
    If values for the UID and PWD keys are not specified, the connection will
    be attempted using Windows Authentication. For a complete list of
    supported keys, see >> SQLSRV Connection Options.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

A connection resource. If a connection cannot be successfully opened, FALSE is
returned.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 Connect using Windows Authentication.

<?php >
    $serverName = "serverName\sqlexpress"; //serverName\instanceName

    // Since UID and PWD are not specified in the $connectionInfo array,
    // The connection will be attempted using Windows Authentication.
    $connectionInfo = array( "Database"=>"dbName");
    $conn = sqlsrv_connect( $serverName, $connectionInfo);

    if( $conn ) {
         echo "Connection established.<br />";
    }else{
         echo "Connection could not be established.<br />";
         die( print_r( sqlsrv_errors(), true));
    }
<?>

Example #2 Connect by specifying a user name and password.

<?php >
    $serverName = "serverName\sqlexpress"; //serverName\instanceName
    $connectionInfo = array( "Database"=>"dbName", "UID"=>"userName", "PWD"=>
    "password");
    $conn = sqlsrv_connect( $serverName, $connectionInfo);

    if( $conn ) {
         echo "Connection established.<br />";
    }else{
         echo "Connection could not be established.<br />";
         die( print_r( sqlsrv_errors(), true));
    }
<?>

Example #3 Connect on a specifed port.

<?php >
    $serverName = "serverName\sqlexpress, 1542"; //serverName\
    instanceName, portNumber (default is 1433)
    $connectionInfo = array( "Database"=>"dbName", "UID"=>"userName", "PWD"=>
    "password");
    $conn = sqlsrv_connect( $serverName, $connectionInfo);

    if( $conn ) {
         echo "Connection established.<br />";
    }else{
         echo "Connection could not be established.<br />";
         die( print_r( sqlsrv_errors(), true));
    }
<?>

==============================================================================
*Notes*

By default, the sqlsrv_connect() uses connection pooling to improve connection
performance. To turn off connection pooling (i.e. force a new connection on
each call), set the "ConnectionPooling" option in the $connectionOptions array
to 0 (or FALSE). For more information, see >> SQLSRV Connection Pooling.

The SQLSRV extension does not have a dedicated function for changing which
database is connected to. The target database is specified in the
$connectionOptions array that is passed to sqlsrv_connect. To change the
database on an open connection, execute the following query "USE dbName" (e.g.
sqlsrv_query($conn, "USE dbName")).
