include

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

The include statement includes and evaluates the specified file.

The documentation below also applies to |require|.

Files are included based on the file path given or, if none is given, the
include_path specified. If the file isn't found in the include_path, include
will finally check in the calling script's own directory and the current
working directory before failing. The include construct will emit a warning if
it cannot find a file; this is different behavior from |require|, which will
emit a fatal error.

If a path is defined — whether absolute (starting with a drive letter or \ on
Windows, or / on Unix/Linux systems) or relative to the current directory
(starting with . or ..) — the include_path will be ignored altogether. For
example, if a filename begins with ../, the parser will look in the parent
directory to find the requested file.

For more information on how PHP handles including files and the include path,
see the documentation for include_path.

When a file is included, the code it contains inherits the variable scope of
the line on which the include occurs. Any variables available at that line in
the calling file will be available within the called file, from that point
forward. However, all functions and classes defined in the included file have
the global scope.

Example #1 Basic include example

vars.php
<?php >

    $color = 'green';
    $fruit = 'apple';

<?>

test.php
<?php >

    echo "A $color $fruit"; // A

    include 'vars.php';

    echo "A $color $fruit"; // A green apple

<?>

If the include occurs inside a function within the calling file, then all of
the code contained in the called file will behave as though it had been
defined inside that function. So, it will follow the variable scope of that
function. An exception to this rule are magic constants which are evaluated by
the parser before the include occurs.

Example #2 Including within functions

<?php >

    function foo()
    {
        global $color;

        include 'vars.php';

        echo "A $color $fruit";
    }

    /* vars.php is in the scope of foo() so     *
    * $fruit is NOT available outside of this  *
    * scope.  $color is because we declared it *
    * as global.                               */

    foo();                    // A green apple
    echo "A $color $fruit";   // A green

<?>

When a file is included, parsing drops out of PHP mode and into HTML mode at
the beginning of the target file, and resumes again at the end. For this
reason, any code inside the target file which should be executed as PHP code
must be enclosed within valid PHP start and end tags.

If "URL include wrappers" are enabled in PHP, you can specify the file to be
included using a URL (via HTTP or other supported wrapper - see Supported
Protocols and Wrappers for a list of protocols) instead of a local pathname.
If the target server interprets the target file as PHP code, variables may be
passed to the included file using a URL request string as used with HTTP GET.
This is not strictly speaking the same thing as including the file and having
it inherit the parent file's variable scope; the script is actually being run
on the remote server and the result is then being included into the local
script.

Example #3 include through HTTP

<?php >

    /* This example assumes that www.example.com is configured to parse .php
    * files and not .txt files. Also, 'Works' here means that the variables
    * $foo and $bar are available within the included file. */

    // Won't work; file.txt wasn't handled by www.example.com as PHP
    include 'http://www.example.com/file.txt?foo=1&bar=2';

    // Won't work; looks for a file named 'file.php?foo=1&bar=2' on the
    // local filesystem.
    include 'file.php?foo=1&bar=2';

    // Works.
    include 'http://www.example.com/file.php?foo=1&bar=2';

    $foo = 1;
    $bar = 2;
    include 'file.txt';  // Works.
    include 'file.php';  // Works.

<?>

Warning

Security warning

Remote file may be processed at the remote server (depending on the file
extension and the fact if the remote server runs PHP or not) but it still has
to produce a valid PHP script because it will be processed at the local
server. If the file from the remote server should be processed there and
outputted only, |readfile| is much better function to use. Otherwise, special
care should be taken to secure the remote script to produce a valid and
desired code.

See also Remote files, |fopen| and |file| for related information.

Handling Returns: include returns FALSE on failure and raises a warning.
Successful includes, unless overridden by the included file, return 1. It is
possible to execute a |return| statement inside an included file in order to
terminate processing in that file and return to the script which called it.
Also, it's possible to return values from included files. You can take the
value of the include call as you would for a normal function. This is not,
however, possible when including remote files unless the output of the remote
file has valid PHP start and end tags (as with any local file). You can
declare the needed variables within those tags and they will be introduced at
whichever point the file was included.

Because include is a special language construct, parentheses are not needed
around its argument. Take care when comparing return value.

Example #4 Comparing return value of include

<?php >
    // won't work, evaluated as include(('vars.php') == TRUE), i.e. include('')
    if (include('vars.php') == TRUE) {
        echo 'OK';
    }

    // works
    if ((include 'vars.php') == TRUE) {
        echo 'OK';
    }
<?>

Example #5 include and the |return| statement

return.php
<?php >

    $var = 'PHP';

    return $var;

<?>

noreturn.php
<?php >

    $var = 'PHP';

<?>

testreturns.php
<?php >

    $foo = include 'return.php';

    echo $foo; // prints 'PHP'

    $bar = include 'noreturn.php';

    echo $bar; // prints 1

<?>

$bar is the value 1 because the include was successful. Notice the difference
between the above examples. The first uses |return| within the included file
while the other does not. If the file can't be included, FALSE is returned and
E_WARNING is issued.

If there are functions defined in the included file, they can be used in the
main file independent if they are before |return| or after. If the file is
included twice, PHP 5 issues fatal error because functions were already
declared, while PHP 4 doesn't complain about functions defined after |return|.
It is recommended to use |include_once| instead of checking if the file was
already included and conditionally return inside the included file.

Another way to "include" a PHP file into a variable is to capture the output
by using the Output Control Functions with include. For example:

Example #6 Using output buffering to include a PHP file into a string

<?php >
    $string = get_include_contents('somefile.php');

    function get_include_contents($filename) {
        if (is_file($filename)) {
            ob_start();
            include $filename;
            return ob_get_clean();
        }
        return false;
    }

<?>

In order to automatically include files within scripts, see also the
auto_prepend_file and auto_append_file configuration options in php.ini.

    Note: Because this is a language construct and not a function, it cannot
    be called using variable functions.

|readfile|, |virtual|, and include_path.
