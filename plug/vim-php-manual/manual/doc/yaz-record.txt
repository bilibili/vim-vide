yaz_record — Returns a record

==============================================================================
*Description*

    string yaz_record ( resource $id , int $pos , string $type )~

The yaz_record() function inspects a record in the current result set at the
position specified by parameter {pos}.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{id}

    The connection resource returned by |yaz_connect|.

{pos}

    The record position. Records positions in a result set are numbered 1, 2,
    ... $hits where $hits is the count returned by |yaz_hits|.

{type}

    The {type} specifies the form of the returned record.

        Note:

        It is the application which is responsible for actually ensuring that
        the records are returned from the Z39.50/SRW server in the proper
        format. The type given only specifies a conversion to take place on
        the client side (in PHP/YAZ).

    Besides conversion of the transfer record to a string/array, PHP/YAZ it is
    also possible to perform a character set conversion of the record.
    Especially for USMARC/MARC21 that is recommended since these are typically
    returned in the character set MARC-8 that is not supported by browsers,
    etc. To specify a conversion, add ; charset=from, to where from is the
    original character set of the record and to is the resulting character set
    (as seen by PHP).

    string

        The record is returned as a string for simple display. In this mode,
        all MARC records are converted to a line-by-line format since ISO2709
        is hardly readable. XML records and SUTRS are returned in their
        original format. GRS-1 are returned in a (ugly) line-by-line format.

        This format is suitable if records are to be displayed in a quick way
        - for debugging - or because it is not feasible to perform proper
        display.

    xml

        The record is returned as an XML string if possible. In this mode, all
        MARC records are converted to >> MARCXML. XML records and SUTRS are
        returned in their original format. GRS-1 is not supported.

        This format is similar to {string} except that MARC records are
        converted to MARCXML

        This format is suitable if records are processed by an XML parser or
        XSLT processor afterwards.

    raw

        The record is returned as a string in its original form. This type is
        suitable for MARC, XML and SUTRS. It does not work for GRS-1.

        MARC records are returned as a ISO2709 string. XML and SUTRS are
        returned as strings.

    syntax

        The syntax of the record is returned as a string, i.e. USmarc, GRS-1,
        XML, etc.

    database

        The name of database associated with record at the position is
        returned as a string.

    array

        The record is returned as an array that reflects the GRS-1 structure.
        This type is suitable for MARC and GRS-1. XML, SUTRS are not supported
        and if the actual record is XML or SUTRS an empty string will be
        returned.

        The array returned consists of a list corresponding to each leaf/
        internal node of GRS-1. Each list item consists a sub list with first
        element path and data (if data is available).

        The path which is a string holds a list of each tree component (of the
        structured GRS-1 record) from root to leaf. Each component is a tag
        type, tag value pair of the form (type, value

        String tags normally has a corresponding tag type 3. MARC can also be
        returned as an array (they are converted to GRS-1 internally).

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns the record at position {pos} or an empty string if no record exists at
the given position.

If no database record exists at the given position an empty string is
returned.

*Examples*

Example #1 Array for GRS-1 record

Consider this GRS-1 record:

(4,52)Robert M. Pirsig
(4,70)
      (4,90)
            (2,7)Transworld Publishers, ltd.

This record has two nodes at root level. First element at root level is (4,52)
[tag type 4, tag value 52], and has data Robert M. Pirsig. Second element at
root level (4,70) has a subtree with a single element (4,90). (4,90) has yet
another sub tree (2,7) with data Transworld Publishers, ltd..

If this record is present at position $p, then
<?php >

    $ar = yaz_record($id, $p, "array");
    print_r($ar);

<?>
will output:

Array
(
    [0] => Array
        (
            [0] => (4,52)
            [1] => Robert M. Pirsig
        )
    [1] => Array
        (
            [0] => (4,70)
        )
    [2] => Array
        (
            [0] => (4,70)(4,90)
        )
    [3] => Array
        (
            [0] => (4,70)(4,90)(2,7)
            [1] => Transworld Publishers, ltd.
        )
)

Example #2 Working with MARCXML

The following PHP snippet returns a MARC21/USMARC record as MARCXML. The
original record is returned in marc-8 (unknown to most XML parsers), so we
convert it to UTF-8 (which all XML parsers must support).
<?php >
    $rec = yaz_record($id, $p, "xml; charset=marc-8,utf-8");
<?>

The record $rec can be processed with the Sablotron XSLT processor as follows:

<?php >

    $xslfile = 'display.xsl';
    $processor = xslt_create();
    $parms = array('/_xml' => $rec);
    $res = xslt_process($processor, 'arg:/_xml', $xslfile, NULL, $parms);
    xslt_free($processor);
    $res = preg_replace("'</?html[^>]*>'", '', $res);
    echo $res;

<?>

For PHP 5 the XSL extension must be used instead of Sablotron XSLT.
