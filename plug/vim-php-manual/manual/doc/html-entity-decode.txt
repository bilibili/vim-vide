html_entity_decode

(PHP 4 >= 4.3.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

html_entity_decode — Convert all HTML entities to their applicable characters

==============================================================================
*Description*

    string html_entity_decode ( string $string [, int $flags = ENT_COMPAT |~
    ENT_HTML401 [, string $encoding = ini_get("default_charset") ]]~
)~

html_entity_decode() is the opposite of |htmlentities| in that it converts all
HTML entities in the {string} to their applicable characters.

More precisely, this function decodes all the entities (including all numeric
entities) that a) are necessarily valid for the chosen document type — i.e.,
for XML, this function does not decode named entities that might be defined in
some DTD — and b) whose character or characters are in the coded character set
associated with the chosen encoding and are permitted in the chosen document
type. All other entities are left as is.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{string}

    The input string.

{flags}

    A bitmask of one or more of the following flags, which specify how to
    handle quotes and which document type to use. The default is ENT_COMPAT |
    ENT_HTML401.

                        Available {flags} constants
    Constant Name                        Description
    ENT_COMPAT    Will convert double-quotes and leave single-quotes alone.
    ENT_QUOTES    Will convert both double and single quotes.
    ENT_NOQUOTES  Will leave both double and single quotes unconverted.
    ENT_HTML401   Handle code as HTML 4.01.
    ENT_XML1      Handle code as XML 1.
    ENT_XHTML     Handle code as XHTML.
    ENT_HTML5     Handle code as HTML 5.

{encoding}

    An optional argument defining the encoding used when converting
    characters.

    If omitted, the default value of the {encoding} varies depending on the
    PHP version in use. In PHP 5.6 and later, the default_charset
    configuration option is used as the default value. PHP 5.4 and 5.5 will
    use UTF-8 as the default. Earlier versions of PHP use ISO-8859-1.

    Although this argument is technically optional, you are highly encouraged
    to specify the correct value for your code if you are using PHP 5.5 or
    earlier, or if your default_charset configuration option may be set
    incorrectly for the given input.

    The following character sets are supported:

                              Supported charsets

*Changelog*

Version                              Description
5.6.0   The default value for the {encoding} parameter was changed to be the
        value of the default_charset configuration option.
5.4.0   Default encoding changed from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8.
5.4.0   The constants ENT_HTML401, ENT_XML1, ENT_XHTML and ENT_HTML5 were
        added.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 Decoding HTML entities

<?php >
    $orig = "I'll \"walk\" the <b>dog</b> now";

    $a = htmlentities($orig);

    $b = html_entity_decode($a);

    echo $a; // I'll &quot;walk&quot; the &lt;b&gt;dog&lt;/b&gt; now

    echo $b; // I'll "walk" the <b>dog</b> now
<?>

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    You might wonder why trim(html_entity_decode('&nbsp;')); doesn't reduce
    the string to an empty string, that's because the '&nbsp;' entity is not
    ASCII code 32 (which is stripped by |trim|) but ASCII code 160 (0xa0) in
    the default ISO 8859-1 encoding.
