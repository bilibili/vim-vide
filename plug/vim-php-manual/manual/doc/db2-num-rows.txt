(PECL ibm_db2 >= 1.0.0)

db2_num_rows — Returns the number of rows affected by an SQL statement

==============================================================================
*Description*

    int db2_num_rows ( resource $stmt )~

Returns the number of rows deleted, inserted, or updated by an SQL statement.

To determine the number of rows that will be returned by a SELECT statement,
issue SELECT COUNT(*) with the same predicates as your intended SELECT
statement and retrieve the value.

If your application logic checks the number of rows returned by a SELECT
statement and branches if the number of rows is 0, consider modifying your
application to attempt to return the first row with one of |db2_fetch_assoc|, 
|db2_fetch_both|, |db2_fetch_array|, or |db2_fetch_row|, and branch if the
fetch function returns FALSE.

    Note:

    If you issue a SELECT statement using a scrollable cursor, db2_num_rows()
    returns the number of rows returned by the SELECT statement. However, the
    overhead associated with scrollable cursors significantly degrades the
    performance of your application, so if this is the only reason you are
    considering using scrollable cursors, you should use a forward-only cursor
    and either call SELECT COUNT(*) or rely on the boolean return value of the
    fetch functions to achieve the equivalent functionality with much better
    performance.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{stmt}

    A valid stmt resource containing a result set.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns the number of rows affected by the last SQL statement issued by the
specified statement handle.
