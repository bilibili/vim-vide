pg_prepare

(PHP 5 >= 5.1.0, PHP 7)

pg_prepare — Submits a request to create a prepared statement with the given
parameters, and waits for completion.

==============================================================================
*Description*

    resource pg_prepare ([ resource $connection ], string $stmtname , string~
    $query )~

pg_prepare() creates a prepared statement for later execution with |pg_execute
| or |pg_send_execute|. This feature allows commands that will be used
repeatedly to be parsed and planned just once, rather than each time they are
executed. pg_prepare() is supported only against PostgreSQL 7.4 or higher
connections; it will fail when using earlier versions.

The function creates a prepared statement named {stmtname} from the {query}
string, which must contain a single SQL command. {stmtname} may be "" to
create an unnamed statement, in which case any pre-existing unnamed statement
is automatically replaced; otherwise it is an error if the statement name is
already defined in the current session. If any parameters are used, they are
referred to in the {query} as $1, $2, etc.

Prepared statements for use with pg_prepare() can also be created by executing
SQL PREPARE statements. (But pg_prepare() is more flexible since it does not
require parameter types to be pre-specified.) Also, although there is no PHP
function for deleting a prepared statement, the SQL DEALLOCATE statement can
be used for that purpose.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{connection}

    PostgreSQL database connection resource. When {connection} is not present,
    the default connection is used. The default connection is the last
    connection made by |pg_connect| or |pg_pconnect|.

{stmtname}

    The name to give the prepared statement. Must be unique per-connection. If
    "" is specified, then an unnamed statement is created, overwriting any
    previously defined unnamed statement.

{query}

    The parameterized SQL statement. Must contain only a single statement.
    (multiple statements separated by semi-colons are not allowed.) If any
    parameters are used, they are referred to as $1, $2, etc.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

A query result resource on success or FALSE on failure.

*Examples*

Example #1 Using pg_prepare()

<?php >
    // Connect to a database named "mary"
    $dbconn = pg_connect("dbname=mary");

    // Prepare a query for execution
    $result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "my_query", 'SELECT * FROM shops WHERE name =
     $1');

    // Execute the prepared query.  Note that it is not necessary to escape
    // the string "Joe's Widgets" in any way
    $result = pg_execute($dbconn, "my_query", array("Joe's Widgets"));

    // Execute the same prepared query, this time with a different parameter
    $result = pg_execute($dbconn, "my_query", array("Clothes Clothes Clothes"));

<?>

*See* *Also*

  * |pg_execute| - Sends a request to execute a prepared statement with given
    parameters, and waits for the result.
  * |pg_send_execute| - Sends a request to execute a prepared statement with
    given parameters, without waiting for the result(s).
