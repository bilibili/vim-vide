mysql_real_escape_string

(PHP 4 >= 4.3.0, PHP 5)

mysql_real_escape_string — Escapes special characters in a string for use in
an SQL statement

Warning

This extension was deprecated in PHP 5.5.0, and it was removed in PHP 7.0.0.
Instead, the MySQLi or PDO_MySQL extension should be used. See also MySQL:
choosing an API guide and related FAQ for more information. Alternatives to
this function include:

  * mysqli_real_escape_string()
  * PDO::quote()

==============================================================================
*Description*

    string mysql_real_escape_string ( string $unescaped_string [, resource~
    $link_identifier = NULL ] )~

Escapes special characters in the {unescaped_string}, taking into account the
current character set of the connection so that it is safe to place it in a 
|mysql_query|. If binary data is to be inserted, this function must be used.

mysql_real_escape_string() calls MySQL's library function
mysql_real_escape_string, which prepends backslashes to the following
characters: \x00, \n, \r, \, ', " and \x1a.

This function must always (with few exceptions) be used to make data safe
before sending a query to MySQL.

Caution

Security: the default character set

The character set must be set either at the server level, or with the API
function |mysql_set_charset| for it to affect mysql_real_escape_string(). See
the concepts section on character sets for more information.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{unescaped_string}

    The string that is to be escaped.

{ link_identifier}

    The MySQL connection. If the link identifier is not specified, the last
    link opened by |mysql_connect| is assumed. If no such link is found, it
    will try to create one as if |mysql_connect| had been called with no
    arguments. If no connection is found or established, an E_WARNING level
    error is generated.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns the escaped string, or FALSE on error.

==============================================================================
*Errors/Exceptions*

Executing this function without a MySQL connection present will also emit
E_WARNING level PHP errors. Only execute this function with a valid MySQL
connection present.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 Simple mysql_real_escape_string() example

<?php >
    // Connect
    $link = mysql_connect('mysql_host', 'mysql_user', 'mysql_password')
        OR die(mysql_error());

    // Query
    $query = sprintf("SELECT * FROM users WHERE user='%s' AND password='%s'",
                mysql_real_escape_string($user),
                mysql_real_escape_string($password));
<?>

Example #2 mysql_real_escape_string() requires a connection example

This example demonstrates what happens if a MySQL connection is not present
when calling this function.

<?php >
    // We have not connected to MySQL

    $lastname  = "O'Reilly";
    $_lastname = mysql_real_escape_string($lastname);

    $query = "SELECT * FROM actors WHERE last_name = '$_lastname'";

    var_dump($_lastname);
    var_dump($query);
<?>

The above example will output something similar to:

Warning: mysql_real_escape_string(): No such file or directory in /this/test/script.php on line 5
Warning: mysql_real_escape_string(): A link to the server could not be established in /this/test/script.php on line 5

bool(false)
string(41) "SELECT * FROM actors WHERE last_name = ''"

Example #3 An example SQL Injection Attack

<?php >
    // We didn't check $_POST['password'], it could be anything the user wanted!
     For example:
    $_POST['username'] = 'aidan';
    $_POST['password'] = "' OR ''='";

    // Query database to check if there are any matching users
    $query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE user='{$_POST['username']}' AND password='
    {$_POST['password']}'";
    mysql_query($query);

    // This means the query sent to MySQL would be:
    echo $query;
<?>

The query sent to MySQL:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE user='aidan' AND password='' OR ''=''

This would allow anyone to log in without a valid password.

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    A MySQL connection is required before using mysql_real_escape_string()
    otherwise an error of level E_WARNING is generated, and FALSE is returned.
    If {link_identifier} isn't defined, the last MySQL connection is used.

    Note:

    If magic_quotes_gpc is enabled, first apply |stripslashes| to the data.
    Using this function on data which has already been escaped will escape the
    data twice.

    Note:

    If this function is not used to escape data, the query is vulnerable to
    SQL Injection Attacks.

    Note: mysql_real_escape_string() does not escape % and _. These are
    wildcards in MySQL if combined with LIKE, GRANT, or REVOKE.
