(PECL paradox >= 1.0.0)

px_set_targetencoding — Sets the encoding for character fields (deprecated)

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool px_set_targetencoding ( resource $pxdoc , string $encoding )~

Set the encoding for data retrieved from a character field. All character
fields will be recoded to the encoding set by this function. If the encoding
is not set, the character data will be returned in the DOS code page encoding
as specified in the database file. The {encoding} can be any string identifier
known to iconv or recode. On Unix systems run iconv -l for a list of available
encodings.

This function is deprecated and should be replaced by calling 
|px_set_parameter|.

See also |px_get_info| to determine the DOS code page as stored in the
database file.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{pxdoc}

    Resource identifier of the paradox database as returned by |px_new|.

{encoding}

    The encoding for the output. Data which is being read from character
    fields is recoded into the targetencoding.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns FALSE if the encoding could not be set, e.g. the encoding is unknown,
or pxlib does not support recoding at all. In the second case a warning will
be issued.
