flock

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

flock — Portable advisory file locking

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool flock ( resource $handle , int $operation [, int &$wouldblock ] )~

flock() allows you to perform a simple reader/writer model which can be used
on virtually every platform (including most Unix derivatives and even
Windows).

On versions of PHP before 5.3.2, the lock is released also by |fclose| (which
is also called automatically when script finished).

PHP supports a portable way of locking complete files in an advisory way
(which means all accessing programs have to use the same way of locking or it
will not work). By default, this function will block until the requested lock
is acquired; this may be controlled with the LOCK_NB option documented below.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{handle}

    A file system pointer resource that is typically created using |fopen|.

{operation}

    {operation} is one of the following:
      + LOCK_SH to acquire a shared lock (reader).
      + LOCK_EX to acquire an exclusive lock (writer).
      + LOCK_UN to release a lock (shared or exclusive).

    It is also possible to add LOCK_NB as a bitmask to one of the above
    operations if you don't want flock() to block while locking.

{wouldblock}

    The optional third argument is set to 1 if the lock would block
    (EWOULDBLOCK errno condition).

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

*Changelog*

Version                               Description
5.5.22,  Added support for the {wouldblock} parameter on Windows.
5.6.6
5.3.2    The automatic unlocking when the file's resource handle is closed was
         removed. Unlocking now always has to be done manually.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 flock() example

<?php >

    $fp = fopen("/tmp/lock.txt", "r+");

    if (flock($fp, LOCK_EX)) {  // acquire an exclusive lock
        ftruncate($fp, 0);      // truncate file
        fwrite($fp, "Write something here\n");
        fflush($fp);            // flush output before releasing the lock
        flock($fp, LOCK_UN);    // release the lock
    } else {
        echo "Couldn't get the lock!";
    }

    fclose($fp);

<?>

Example #2 flock() using the LOCK_NB option

<?php >
    $fp = fopen('/tmp/lock.txt', 'r+');

    /* Activate the LOCK_NB option on an LOCK_EX operation */
    if(!flock($fp, LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)) {
        echo 'Unable to obtain lock';
        exit(-1);
    }

    /* ... */

    fclose($fp);
<?>

*Notes*

    Note:

    flock() uses mandatory locking instead of advisory locking on Windows.
    Mandatory locking is also supported on Linux and System V based operating
    systems via the usual mechanism supported by the fcntl() system call: that
    is, if the file in question has the setgid permission bit set and the
    group execution bit cleared. On Linux, the file system will also need to
    be mounted with the mand option for this to work.

    Note:

    Because flock() requires a file pointer, you may have to use a special
    lock file to protect access to a file that you intend to truncate by
    opening it in write mode (with a "w" or "w+" argument to |fopen|).

    Note:

    May only be used on file pointers returned by |fopen| for local files, or
    file pointers pointing to userspace streams that implement the 
    streamWrapper::stream_lock() method.

Warning

Assigning another value to {handle} argument in subsequent code will release
the lock.

Warning

On some operating systems flock() is implemented at the process level. When
using a multithreaded server API like ISAPI you may not be able to rely on 
flock() to protect files against other PHP scripts running in parallel threads
of the same server instance!

flock() is not supported on antiquated filesystems like FAT and its derivates
and will therefore always return FALSE under this environments (this is
especially true for Windows 98 users).
