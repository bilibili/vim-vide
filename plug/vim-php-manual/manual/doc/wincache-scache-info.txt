{summaryonly}

    Controls whether the returned array will contain information about
    individual cache entries along with the session cache summary.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Array of meta data about session cache or FALSE on failure

The array returned by this function contains the following elements:

  * total_cache_uptime - total time in seconds that the session cache has been
    active
  * total_item_count - total number of elements that are currently in the
    session cache
  * is_local_cache - true is the cache metadata is for a local cache instance,
    false if the metadata is for the global cache
  * total_hit_count - number of times the data has been served from the cache
  * total_miss_count - number of times the data has not been found in the
    cache
  * scache_entries - an array that contains the information about all the
    cached items:
      + key_name - name of the key which is used to store the data
      + value_type - type of value stored by the key
      + use_time - time in seconds since the file has been accessed in the
        opcode cache
      + last_check - time in seconds since the file has been checked for
        modifications
      + ttl_seconds - time remaining for the data to live in the cache, 0
        meaning infinite
      + age_seconds - time elapsed from the time data has been added in the
        cache
      + hitcount - number of times data has been served from the cache

*Examples*

Example #1 A wincache_scache_info() example

<pre>
<?php >
    print_r(wincache_scache_info());
<?>
</pre>

The above example will output:

    [total_cache_uptime] => 17357
    [total_file_count] => 121
    [total_hit_count] => 36562
    [total_miss_count] => 201
    [scache_entries] => Array
        (
            [1] => Array
                (
                    [file_name] => c:\inetpub\wwwroot\checkcache.php
                    [add_time] => 17356
                    [use_time] => 7
                    [last_check] => 10
                    [hit_count] => 454
                    [function_count] => 0
                    [class_count] => 1
                )
            [2] => Array (...iterates for each cached file)
        )
