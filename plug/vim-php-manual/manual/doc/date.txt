date

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

date — Format a local time/date

==============================================================================
*Description*

    string date ( string $format [, int $timestamp = time() ] )~

Returns a string formatted according to the given format string using the
given integer {timestamp} or the current time if no timestamp is given. In
other words, {timestamp} is optional and defaults to the value of |time|.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{format}

    The format of the outputted date string. See the formatting options below.
    There are also several predefined date constants that may be used instead,
    so for example DATE_RSS contains the format string 'D, d M Y H:i:s'.

      The following characters are recognized in the {format} parameter

               Note that date() will always generate
    u          000000 since it takes an integer      Example: 654321
               parameter, whereas DateTime::format()
               does support microseconds if DateTime
               was created with microseconds.

    Z          offset for timezones west of UTC is   -43200 through 50400
               always negative, and for those east

    Unrecognized characters in the format string will be printed as-is. The Z
    format will always return 0 when using |gmdate|.

        Note:

        Since this function only accepts integer timestamps the u format
        character is only useful when using the |date_format| function with
        user based timestamps created with |date_create|.

{timestamp}

    The optional {timestamp} parameter is an integer Unix timestamp that
    defaults to the current local time if a {timestamp} is not given. In other
    words, it defaults to the value of |time|.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns a formatted date string. If a non-numeric value is used for
{timestamp}, FALSE is returned and an E_WARNING level error is emitted.

==============================================================================
*Errors/Exceptions*

Every call to a date/time function will generate a E_NOTICE if the time zone
is not valid, and/or a E_STRICT or E_WARNING message if using the system
settings or the TZ environment variable. See also |date_default_timezone_set|

==============================================================================
*Changelog*

Version                              Description
        The valid range of a timestamp is typically from Fri, 13 Dec 1901
        20:45:54 GMT to Tue, 19 Jan 2038 03:14:07 GMT. (These are the dates
5.1.0   that correspond to the minimum and maximum values for a 32-bit signed
        integer). However, before PHP 5.1.0 this range was limited from
        01-01-1970 to 19-01-2038 on some systems (e.g. Windows).
5.1.0   Now issues the E_STRICT and E_NOTICE time zone errors.

5.1.1   There are useful constants of standard date/time formats that can be
        used to specify the {format} parameter.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 date() examples

<?php >
    // set the default timezone to use. Available since PHP 5.1
    date_default_timezone_set('UTC');


    // Prints something like: Monday
    echo date("l");

    // Prints something like: Monday 8th of August 2005 03:12:46 PM
    echo date('l jS \of F Y h:i:s A');

    // Prints: July 1, 2000 is on a Saturday
    echo "July 1, 2000 is on a " . date("l", mktime(0, 0, 0, 7, 1, 2000));

    /* use the constants in the format parameter */
    // prints something like: Wed, 25 Sep 2013 15:28:57 -0700
    echo date(DATE_RFC2822);

    // prints something like: 2000-07-01T00:00:00+00:00
    echo date(DATE_ATOM, mktime(0, 0, 0, 7, 1, 2000));
<?>

You can prevent a recognized character in the format string from being
expanded by escaping it with a preceding backslash. If the character with a
backslash is already a special sequence, you may need to also escape the
backslash.

Example #2 Escaping characters in date()

<?php >
    // prints something like: Wednesday the 15th
    echo date('l \t\h\e jS');
<?>

It is possible to use date() and |mktime| together to find dates in the future
or the past.

Example #3 date() and |mktime| example

<?php >
    $tomorrow  = mktime(0, 0, 0, date("m")  , date("d")+1, date("Y"));
    $lastmonth = mktime(0, 0, 0, date("m")-1, date("d"),   date("Y"));
    $nextyear  = mktime(0, 0, 0, date("m"),   date("d"),   date("Y")+1);
<?>


    Note:

    This can be more reliable than simply adding or subtracting the number of
    seconds in a day or month to a timestamp because of daylight saving time.

Some examples of date() formatting. Note that you should escape any other
characters, as any which currently have a special meaning will produce
undesirable results, and other characters may be assigned meaning in future
PHP versions. When escaping, be sure to use single quotes to prevent
characters like \n from becoming newlines.

Example #4 date() Formatting

<?php >
    // Assuming today is March 10th, 2001, 5:16:18 pm, and that we are in the
    // Mountain Standard Time (MST) Time Zone

    $today = date("F j, Y, g:i a");                 // March 10, 2001, 5:16 pm
    $today = date("m.d.y");                         // 03.10.01
    $today = date("j, n, Y");                       // 10, 3, 2001
    $today = date("Ymd");                           // 20010310
    $today = date('h-i-s, j-m-y, it is w Day');     //
     05-16-18, 10-03-01, 1631 1618 6 Satpm01
    $today = date('\i\t \i\s \t\h\e jS \d\a\y.');   // it is the 10th day.
    $today = date("D M j G:i:s T Y");               //
     Sat Mar 10 17:16:18 MST 2001
    $today = date('H:m:s \m \i\s\ \m\o\n\t\h');     // 17:03:18 m is month
    $today = date("H:i:s");                         // 17:16:18
    $today = date("Y-m-d H:i:s");                   // 2001-03-10 17:16:18 
    (the MySQL DATETIME format)
<?>

To format dates in other languages, you should use the |setlocale| and 
|strftime| functions instead of date().

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    To generate a timestamp from a string representation of the date, you may
    be able to use |strtotime|. Additionally, some databases have functions to
    convert their date formats into timestamps (such as MySQL's >>
     UNIX_TIMESTAMP function).

Tip

Timestamp of the start of the request is available in $_SERVER['REQUEST_TIME']
since PHP 5.1.
