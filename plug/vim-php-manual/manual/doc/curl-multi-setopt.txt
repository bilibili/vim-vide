==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool curl_multi_setopt ( resource $mh , int $option , mixed $value )~

Warning

This function is currently not documented; only its argument list is
available.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{mh}

{option}

    One of the CURLMOPT_* constants.

{value}

    The value to be set on {option}.

    {value} should be an int for the following values of the {option}
    parameter:

                   Option                           Set {value} to
                                         Pass 1 to enable or 0 to disable.
                                         Enabling pipelining on a multi handle
                                         will make it attempt to perform HTTP
                                         Pipelining as far as possible for
                                         transfers using this handle. This
                                         means that if you add a second
                                         request that can use an already
    CURLMOPT_PIPELINING                  existing connection, the second
                                         request will be "piped" on the same
                                         connection. As of cURL 7.43.0 you can
                                         also pass 2 to try to multiplex the
                                         new transfer over an existing HTTP/2
                                         connection if possible. Instead of
                                         integer literals, you can also use
                                         the CURLPIPE_* constants if
                                         available.
                                         Pass a number that will be used as
                                         the maximum amount of simultaneously
                                         open connections that libcurl may
                                         cache. By default the size will be
                                         enlarged to fit four times the number
    CURLMOPT_MAXCONNECTS                 of handles added via 
                                         |curl_multi_add_handle|. When the
                                         cache is full, curl closes the oldest
                                         one in the cache to prevent the
                                         number of open connections from
                                         increasing.
                                         Pass a number that specifies the
    CURLMOPT_CHUNK_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE   chunk length threshold for pipelining
                                         in bytes.
                                         Pass a number that specifies the size
    CURLMOPT_CONTENT_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE threshold for pipelining penalty in
                                         bytes.
                                         Pass a number that specifies the
    CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS        maximum number of connections to a
                                         single host.
                                         Pass a number that specifies the
    CURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH         maximum number of requests in a
                                         pipeline.
                                         Pass a number that specifies the
    CURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS       maximum number of simultaneously open
                                         connections.
                                         Pass a callable that will be
                                         registered to handle server pushes
                                         and should have the following
                                         signature:

                                         int pushfunction ( resource
                                         $parent_ch , resource $pushed_ch ,
                                         array~
                                         $headers )~

                                         {parent_ch}

                                             The parent cURL handle (the
    CURLMOPT_PUSHFUNCTION                    request the client made).

                                         {pushed_ch}

                                             A new cURL handle for the pushed
                                             request.

                                         {headers}

                                             The push promise headers.

                                         The push function is supposed to
                                         return either CURL_PUSH_OK if it can
                                         handle the push, or CURL_PUSH_DENY to
                                         reject it.
