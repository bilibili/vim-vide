stream_select

(PHP 4 >= 4.3.0, PHP 5, PHP 7)

stream_select — Runs the equivalent of the select() system call on the given
arrays of streams with a timeout specified by tv_sec and tv_usec

==============================================================================
*Description*

    int stream_select ( array &$read , array &$write , array &$except , int~
    $tv_sec [, int $tv_usec = 0 ] )~

The stream_select() function accepts arrays of streams and waits for them to
change status. Its operation is equivalent to that of the |socket_select|
function except in that it acts on streams.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{read}

    The streams listed in the {read} array will be watched to see if
    characters become available for reading (more precisely, to see if a read
    will not block - in particular, a stream resource is also ready on
    end-of-file, in which case an |fread| will return a zero length string).

{write}

    The streams listed in the {write} array will be watched to see if a write
    will not block.

{except}

    The streams listed in the {except} array will be watched for high priority
    exceptional ("out-of-band") data arriving.

        Note:

        When stream_select() returns, the arrays {read}, {write} and {except}
        are modified to indicate which stream resource(s) actually changed
        status.

    You do not need to pass every array to stream_select(). You can leave it
    out and use an empty array or NULL instead. Also do not forget that those
    arrays are passed by reference and will be modified after stream_select()
    returns.
{tv_sec}

    The {tv_sec} and {tv_usec} together form the timeout parameter, {tv_sec}
    specifies the number of seconds while {tv_usec} the number of
    microseconds. The {timeout} is an upper bound on the amount of time that 
    stream_select() will wait before it returns. If {tv_sec} and {tv_usec} are
    both set to 0, stream_select() will not wait for data - instead it will
    return immediately, indicating the current status of the streams.

    If {tv_sec} is NULL stream_select() can block indefinitely, returning only
    when an event on one of the watched streams occurs (or if a signal
    interrupts the system call).

    Warning

    Using a timeout value of 0 allows you to instantaneously poll the status
    of the streams, however, it is NOT a good idea to use a 0 timeout value in
    a loop as it will cause your script to consume too much CPU time.

    It is much better to specify a timeout value of a few seconds, although if
    you need to be checking and running other code concurrently, using a
    timeout value of at least 200000 microseconds will help reduce the CPU
    usage of your script.

    Remember that the timeout value is the maximum time that will elapse; 
    stream_select() will return as soon as the requested streams are ready for
    use.

{tv_usec}

    See {tv_sec} description.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

On success stream_select() returns the number of stream resources contained in
the modified arrays, which may be zero if the timeout expires before anything
interesting happens. On error FALSE is returned and a warning raised (this can
happen if the system call is interrupted by an incoming signal).

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 stream_select() Example

This example checks to see if data has arrived for reading on either $stream1
or $stream2. Since the timeout value is 0 it will return immediately:

<?php >
    /* Prepare the read array */
    $read   = array($stream1, $stream2);
    $write  = NULL;
    $except = NULL;
    if (false === ($num_changed_streams = stream_select($read, $write, $except, 0
    ))) {
        /* Error handling */
    } elseif ($num_changed_streams > 0) {
        /* At least on one of the streams something interesting happened */
    }
<?>

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    Due to a limitation in the current Zend Engine it is not possible to pass
    a constant modifier like NULL directly as a parameter to a function which
    expects this parameter to be passed by reference. Instead use a temporary
    variable or an expression with the leftmost member being a temporary
    variable:
    <?php >
    $e = NULL;
    stream_select($r, $w, $e, 0);
<    ?>

    Note:

    Be sure to use the === operator when checking for an error. Since the 
    stream_select() may return 0 the comparison with == would evaluate to TRUE
    :
    <?php >
    $e = NULL;
    if (false === stream_select($r, $w, $e, 0)) {
        echo "stream_select() failed\n";
    }
<    ?>

    Note:

    If you read/write to a stream returned in the arrays be aware that they do
    not necessarily read/write the full amount of data you have requested. Be
    prepared to even only be able to read/write a single byte.

    Note:

    Some streams (like zlib) cannot be selected by this function.

    Note:

    Windows compatibility: stream_select() used on a pipe returned from 
    |proc_open| may cause data loss under Windows 98.

    Use of stream_select() on file descriptors returned by |proc_open| will
    fail and return FALSE under Windows.
