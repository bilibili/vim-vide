exif_read_data — Reads the EXIF headers from JPEG or TIFF

==============================================================================
*Description*

    array exif_read_data ( string $filename [, string $sections = NULL [,~
    bool $arrays = false [, bool $thumbnail = false ]]] )~

exif_read_data() reads the EXIF headers from a JPEG or TIFF image file. This
way you can read meta data generated by digital cameras.

EXIF headers tend to be present in JPEG/TIFF images generated by digital
cameras, but unfortunately each digital camera maker has a different idea of
how to actually tag their images, so you can't always rely on a specific Exif
header being present.

Height and Width are computed the same way |getimagesize| does so their values
must not be part of any header returned. Also, html is a height/width text
string to be used inside normal HTML.

When an Exif header contains a Copyright note, this itself can contain two
values. As the solution is inconsistent in the Exif 2.10 standard, the
COMPUTED section will return both entries Copyright.Photographer and
Copyright.Editor while the IFD0 sections contains the byte array with the NULL
character that splits both entries. Or just the first entry if the datatype
was wrong (normal behaviour of Exif). The COMPUTED will also contain the entry
Copyright which is either the original copyright string, or a comma separated
list of the photo and editor copyright.

The tag UserComment has the same problem as the Copyright tag. It can store
two values. First the encoding used, and second the value itself. If so the
IFD section only contains the encoding or a byte array. The COMPUTED section
will store both in the entries UserCommentEncoding and UserComment. The entry
UserComment is available in both cases so it should be used in preference to
the value in IFD0 section.

exif_read_data() also validates EXIF data tags according to the EXIF
specification (>> http://exif.org/Exif2-2.PDF, page 20).

    Note:

    Windows Me/XP can both wipe the Exif headers when connecting to a camera.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{filename}

    The name of the image file being read. This cannot be an URL.

{sections}

    Is a comma separated list of sections that need to be present in file to
    produce a result array. If none of the requested sections could be found
    the return value is FALSE.

    FILE      FileName, FileSize, FileDateTime, SectionsFound
              html, Width, Height, IsColor, and more if available. Height and
    COMPUTED  Width are computed the same way |getimagesize| does so their
              values must not be part of any header returned. Also, html is a
              height/width text string to be used inside normal HTML.
    ANY_TAG   Any information that has a Tag e.g. IFD0, EXIF, ...
    IFD0      All tagged data of IFD0. In normal imagefiles this contains
              image size and so forth.
              A file is supposed to contain a thumbnail if it has a second IFD
    THUMBNAIL . All tagged information about the embedded thumbnail is stored
              in this section.
    COMMENT   Comment headers of JPEG images.
              The EXIF section is a sub section of IFD0. It contains more
    EXIF      detailed information about an image. Most of these entries are
              digital camera related.

{arrays}

    Specifies whether or not each section becomes an array. The {sections}
    COMPUTED, THUMBNAIL, and COMMENT always become arrays as they may contain
    values whose names conflict with other sections.

{thumbnail}

    When set to TRUE the thumbnail itself is read. Otherwise, only the tagged
    data is read.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

It returns an associative array where the array indexes are the header names
and the array values are the values associated with those headers. If no data
can be returned, exif_read_data() will return FALSE.

==============================================================================
*Changelog*

Version                              Description
        Can read all embedded IFD data including arrays (returned as such).
        Also the size of an embedded thumbnail is returned in a THUMBNAIL
4.3.0   subarray, and can return thumbnails in TIFF format. Also, there is no
        longer a maximum length for returned values (not until the memory
        limit has been reached)
        If PHP has mbstring support, the user comment can automatically change
4.3.0   encoding. Also, if the user comment uses Unicode or JIS encoding this
        encoding will automatically be changed according to the exif ini
        settings in php.ini
        If the image contains any IFD0 data then COMPUTED contains the entry
        ByteOrderMotorola which is 0 for little-endian (intel) and 1 for
4.3.0   big-endian (motorola) byte order. Also, COMPUTED and UserComment no
        longer only contain the first copyright entry if the datatype was
        wrong.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 exif_read_data() example

<?php >
    echo "test1.jpg:<br />\n";
    $exif = exif_read_data('tests/test1.jpg', 'IFD0');
    echo $exif===false ? "No header data found.<br />\n" : "Image contains headers
    <br />\n";

    $exif = exif_read_data('tests/test2.jpg', 0, true);
    echo "test2.jpg:<br />\n";
    foreach ($exif as $key => $section) {
        foreach ($section as $name => $val) {
            echo "$key.$name: $val<br />\n";
        }
    }
<?>

The first call fails because the image has no header information.

The above example will output something similar to:

test1.jpg:
No header data found.
test2.jpg:
FILE.FileName: test2.jpg
FILE.FileDateTime: 1017666176
FILE.FileSize: 1240
FILE.FileType: 2
FILE.SectionsFound: ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, COMMENT
COMPUTED.html: width="1" height="1"
COMPUTED.Height: 1
COMPUTED.Width: 1
COMPUTED.IsColor: 1
COMPUTED.ByteOrderMotorola: 1
COMPUTED.UserComment: Exif test image.
