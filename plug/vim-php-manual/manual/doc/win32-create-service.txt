win32_create_service — Creates a new service entry in the SCM database

==============================================================================
*Description*

    mixed win32_create_service ( array $details [, string $machine ] )~

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{details}

    An array of service details:

    {service}

        The short name of the service. This is the name that you will use to
        control the service using the net command. The service must be unique
        (no two services can share the same name), and, ideally, should avoid
        having spaces in the name.

    {display}

        The display name of the service. This is the name that you will see in
        the Services Applet.

    {description}

        The long description of the service. This is the description that you
        will see in the Services Applet.

    {user}

        The name of the user account under which you want the service to run.
        If omitted, the service will run as the LocalSystem account. If the
        username is specified, you must also provide a password.

    {password}

        The password that corresponds to the {user}.

    {path}

        The full path to the executable module that will be launched when the
        service is started. If omitted, the path to the current PHP process
        will be used.

    {params}

        Command line parameters to pass to the service when it starts. If you
        want to run a PHP script as the service, then the first parameter
        should be the full path to the PHP script that you intend to run. If
        the script name or path contains spaces, then wrap the full path to
        the PHP script with ".

    {load_order}

        Controls the load_order. This is not yet fully supported.

    {svc_type}

        Sets the service type. If omitted, the default value is
        WIN32_SERVICE_WIN32_OWN_PROCESS. Don't change this unless you know
        what you're doing.

    {start_type}

        Specifies how the service should be started. The default is
        WIN32_SERVICE_AUTO_START which means the service will be launched when
        the machine starts up.

    {error_control}

        Informs the SCM what it should do when it detects a problem with the
        service. The default is WIN32_SERVER_ERROR_IGNORE. Changing this value
        is not yet fully supported.

    {delayed_start}

        If {delayed_start} is set to TRUE, then this will inform the SCM that
        this service should be started after other auto-start services are
        started plus a short delay.

        Any service can be marked as a delayed auto-start service; however,
        this setting has no effect unless the service's {start_type} is
        WIN32_SERVICE_AUTO_START.

        This setting is only applicable on Windows Vista and Windows Server
        2008 or greater.

    {base_priority}

        To reduce the impact on processor utilisation, it may be necessary to
        set a base priority lower than normal.

        The {base_priority} can be set to one of the constants define in Win32
        Base Priority Classes.

{machine}

    The optional machine name on which you want to create a service. If
    omitted, it will use the local machine.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns WIN32_NO_ERROR on success, FALSE if there is a problem with the
parameters or a Win32 Error Code on failure.

    ));
