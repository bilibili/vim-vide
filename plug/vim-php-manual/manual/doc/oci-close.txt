oci_close

(PHP 5, PHP 7, PECL OCI8 >= 1.1.0)

oci_close — Closes an Oracle connection

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool oci_close ( resource $connection )~

Unsets {connection}. The underlying database connection is closed if no other
resources are using it and if it was created with |oci_connect| or 
|oci_new_connect|.

It is recommended to close connections that are no longer needed because this
makes database resources available for other users.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{connection}

    An Oracle connection identifier returned by |oci_connect|, |oci_pconnect|,
    or |oci_new_connect|.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 Closing a connection

Resources associated with a connection should be closed to ensure the
underlying database connection is properly terminated and the database
resources are released.

<?php >

    $conn = oci_connect('hr', 'welcome', 'localhost/XE');
    if (!$conn) {
        $e = oci_error();
        trigger_error(htmlentities($e['message'], ENT_QUOTES), E_USER_ERROR);
    }

    $stid = oci_parse($conn, 'SELECT * FROM departments');
    $r = oci_execute($stid);
    oci_fetch_all($stid, $res);
    var_dump($res);

    // Free the statement identifier when closing the connection
    oci_free_statement($stid);
    oci_close($conn);

<?>

Example #2 Database connections are not closed until all references are closed

The internal refcount of a connection identifier must be zero before the
underlying connection to the database is closed.

<?php >

    $conn = oci_connect('hr', 'welcome', 'localhost/XE');
    if (!$conn) {
        $e = oci_error();
        trigger_error(htmlentities($e['message'], ENT_QUOTES), E_USER_ERROR);
    }

    $stid = oci_parse($conn, 'SELECT * FROM departments');  //
     this increases the refcount on $conn
    oci_execute($stid);
    oci_fetch_all($stid, $res);
    var_dump($res);

    oci_close($conn);

    // $conn is no longer usable in the script but the underlying database
    // connection is still held open until $stid is freed.
    var_dump($conn);  // prints NULL  

    // While PHP sleeps, querying the Oracle V$SESSION view in a
    // terminal window will show that the database user is still connected.
    sleep(10);

    // When $stid is freed, the database connection is physically closed
    oci_free_statement($stid);  

    // While PHP sleeps, querying the Oracle V$SESSION view in a
    // terminal window will show that the database user has disconnected.
    sleep(10);

<?>

Example #3 Closing a connection opened more than once

When database credentials are reused, both connections must be closed before
the underlying database connection is closed.

<?php >

    $conn1 = oci_connect('hr', 'welcome', 'localhost/XE');

    // Using the same credentials reuses the same underlying database connection
    // Any uncommitted changes done on $conn1 will be visible in $conn2
    $conn2 = oci_connect('hr', 'welcome', 'localhost/XE');

    // While PHP sleeps, querying the Oracle V$SESSION view in a
    // terminal window will show that only one database user is connected.
    sleep(10);

    oci_close($conn1); // doesn't close the underlying database connection
    var_dump($conn1);  //
     prints NULL because the variable $conn1 is no longer usable
    var_dump($conn2);  //
     displays that $conn2 is still a valid connection resource

<?>

Example #4 Connections are closed when variables go out of scope

When all variables referencing a connection go out of scope and are freed by
PHP, a rollback occurs (if necessary) and the underlying connection to the
database is closed.

<?php >

    function myfunc() {
        $conn = oci_connect('hr', 'hrpwd', 'localhost/XE');
        if (!$conn) {
            $e = oci_error();
            trigger_error(htmlentities($e['message'], ENT_QUOTES), E_USER_ERROR);
        }

        $stid = oci_parse($conn, 'UPDATE mytab SET id = 100');
        oci_execute($stid, OCI_NO_AUTO_COMMIT);
        return "Finished";
    }

    $r = myfunc();
    //
     At this point a rollback occurred and the underlying database connection was released.

    print $r;  // displays the function return value "Finished"

<?>

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    Variables that have a dependency on the connection identifier, such as
    statement identifiers returned by |oci_parse|, must also be freed before
    the underlying database connection is closed.

    Note:

    Prior to version PHP 5.1.2 (PECL OCI8 1.1) oci_close() was a no-op. In
    more recent versions it correctly closes the Oracle connection. Use
    oci8.old_oci_close_semantics option to restore old behavior of this
    function.

    Note:

    The oci_close() function does not close the underlying database
    connections created with |oci_pconnect|.
