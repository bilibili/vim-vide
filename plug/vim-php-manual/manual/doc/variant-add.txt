(PHP 5, PHP 7)

variant_add — "Adds" two variant values together and returns the result

==============================================================================
*Description*

    mixed variant_add ( mixed $left , mixed $right )~

Adds {left} to {right} using the following rules (taken from the MSDN
library), which correspond to those of Visual Basic:

                            Variant Addition Rules
                         If                                    Then
Both expressions are of the string type              Concatenation
One expression is a string type and the other a      Addition
character
One expression is numeric and the other is a string  Addition
Both expressions are numeric                         Addition
Either expression is NULL                            NULL is returned
Both expressions are empty                           Integer subtype is
                                                     returned

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{left}

    The left operand.

{right}

    The right operand.

    Note:

    As with all the variant arithmetic functions, the parameters for this
    function can be either a PHP native type (integer, string, floating point,
    boolean or NULL), or an instance of a COM, VARIANT or DOTNET class. PHP
    native types will be converted to variants using the same rules as found
    in the constructor for the VARIANT class. COM and DOTNET objects will have
    the value of their default property taken and used as the variant value.

    The variant arithmetic functions are wrappers around the similarly named
    functions in the COM library; for more information on these functions,
    consult the MSDN library. The PHP functions are named slightly
    differently; for example variant_add() in PHP corresponds to VarAdd() in
    the MSDN documentation.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns the result.
