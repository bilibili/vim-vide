htmlspecialchars

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

htmlspecialchars — Convert special characters to HTML entities

==============================================================================
*Description*

    string htmlspecialchars ( string $string [, int $flags = ENT_COMPAT |~
    ENT_HTML401 [, string $encoding = ini_get("default_charset") [,~
    bool $double_encode = true ]]] )~

Certain characters have special significance in HTML, and should be
represented by HTML entities if they are to preserve their meanings. This
function returns a string with these conversions made. If you require all
input substrings that have associated named entities to be translated, use 
|htmlentities| instead.

If the input string passed to this function and the final document share the
same character set, this function is sufficient to prepare input for inclusion
in most contexts of an HTML document. If, however, the input can represent
characters that are not coded in the final document character set and you wish
to retain those characters (as numeric or named entities), both this function
and |htmlentities| (which only encodes substrings that have named entity
equivalents) may be insufficient. You may have to use |mb_encode_numericentity
| instead.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{string}

    The string being converted.

{flags}

    A bitmask of one or more of the following flags, which specify how to
    handle quotes, invalid code unit sequences and the used document type. The
    default is ENT_COMPAT | ENT_HTML401.

                         Available {flags} constants
    Constant Name                          Description
    ENT_COMPAT     Will convert double-quotes and leave single-quotes alone.
    ENT_QUOTES     Will convert both double and single quotes.
    ENT_NOQUOTES   Will leave both double and single quotes unconverted.
                   Silently discard invalid code unit sequences instead of
    ENT_IGNORE     returning an empty string. Using this flag is discouraged
                   as it >> may have security implications.
                   Replace invalid code unit sequences with a Unicode
    ENT_SUBSTITUTE Replacement Character U+FFFD (UTF-8) or &#xFFFD;
                   (otherwise) instead of returning an empty string.
                   Replace invalid code points for the given document type
                   with a Unicode Replacement Character U+FFFD (UTF-8) or &#
    ENT_DISALLOWED xFFFD; (otherwise) instead of leaving them as is. This may
                   be useful, for instance, to ensure the well-formedness of
                   XML documents with embedded external content.
    ENT_HTML401    Handle code as HTML 4.01.
    ENT_XML1       Handle code as XML 1.
    ENT_XHTML      Handle code as XHTML.
    ENT_HTML5      Handle code as HTML 5.

{encoding}

    An optional argument defining the encoding used when converting
    characters.

    If omitted, the default value of the {encoding} varies depending on the
    PHP version in use. In PHP 5.6 and later, the default_charset
    configuration option is used as the default value. PHP 5.4 and 5.5 will
    use UTF-8 as the default. Earlier versions of PHP use ISO-8859-1.

    Although this argument is technically optional, you are highly encouraged
    to specify the correct value for your code if you are using PHP 5.5 or
    earlier, or if your default_charset configuration option may be set
    incorrectly for the given input.

    For the purposes of this function, the encodings ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-15,
    UTF-8, cp866, cp1251, cp1252, and KOI8-R are effectively equivalent,
    provided the {string} itself is valid for the encoding, as the characters
    affected by htmlspecialchars() occupy the same positions in all of these
    encodings.

    The following character sets are supported:

                              Supported charsets
      Charset      Aliases                      Description

                              |), in this order. Not recommended.

        Note: Any other character sets are not recognized. The default
        encoding will be used instead and a warning will be emitted.

{double_encode}

    When {double_encode} is turned off PHP will not encode existing html
    entities, the default is to convert everything.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

The converted string.

If the input {string} contains an invalid code unit sequence within the given
{encoding} an empty string will be returned, unless either the ENT_IGNORE or
ENT_SUBSTITUTE flags are set.
