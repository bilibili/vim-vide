session_register

(PHP 4, PHP 5 < 5.4.0)

session_register — Register one or more global variables with the current
session

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool session_register ( mixed $name [, mixed $... ] )~

session_register() accepts a variable number of arguments, any of which can be
either a string holding the name of a variable or an array consisting of
variable names or other arrays. For each name, session_register() registers
the global variable with that name in the current session.

You can also create a session variable by simply setting the appropriate
member of the $_SESSION array.
<?php >
    // Use of session_register() is deprecated
    $barney = "A big purple dinosaur.";
    session_register("barney");

    // Use of $_SESSION is preferred
    $_SESSION["zim"] = "An invader from another planet.";
<?>

If |session_start| was not called before this function is called, an implicit
call to |session_start| with no parameters will be made. $_SESSION does not
mimic this behavior and requires |session_start| before use.

Warning

This function has been DEPRECATED as of PHP 5.3.0 and REMOVED as of PHP 5.4.0.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{name}

    A string holding the name of a variable or an array consisting of variable
    names or other arrays.

{...}

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

*Notes*

Caution

If you want your script to work regardless of register_globals, you need to
instead use the $_SESSION array as $_SESSION entries are automatically
registered. If your script uses session_register(), it will not work in
environments where the PHP directive register_globals is disabled.

    Note: register_globals: important note

    As of PHP 4.2.0, the default value for the PHP directive register_globals
    is off. The PHP community discourages developers from relying on this
    directive, and encourages the use of other means, such as the superglobals
    .

Caution

This registers a global variable. If you want to register a session variable
from within a function, you need to make sure to make it global using the
`global` keyword or the $GLOBALS[] array, or use the special session arrays as
noted below.

Caution

If you are using $_SESSION, do not use session_register(), 
|session_is_registered|, and |session_unregister|.

    Note:

    It is currently impossible to register resource variables in a session.
    For example, you cannot create a connection to a database and store the
    connection id as a session variable and expect the connection to still be
    valid the next time the session is restored. PHP functions that return a
    resource are identified by having a return type of resource in their
    function definition. A list of functions that return resources are
    available in the resource types appendix.

    If $_SESSION is used, assign values to $_SESSION. For example: $_SESSION
    ['var'] = 'ABC';
