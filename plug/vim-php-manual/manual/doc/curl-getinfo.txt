  * "http_code"
  * "header_size"
  * "request_size"
  * "filetime"

*Examples*

Example #1 curl_getinfo() example

<?php >
    // Create a cURL handle
    $ch = curl_init('http://www.example.com/');

    // Execute
    curl_exec($ch);

    // Check if any error occurred
    if (!curl_errno($ch)) {
      $info = curl_getinfo($ch);
      echo 'Took ', $info['total_time'], ' seconds to send a request to ', $info[
    'url'], "\n";
    }

    // Close handle
    curl_close($ch);
<?>

Example #2 curl_getinfo() example with {opt} parameter

<?php >
    // Create a cURL handle
    $ch = curl_init('http://www.example.com/');

    // Execute
    curl_exec($ch);

    // Check HTTP status code
    if (!curl_errno($ch)) {
      switch ($http_code = curl_getinfo($ch, CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE)) {
        case 200:  # OK
          break;
        default:
          echo 'Unexpected HTTP code: ', $http_code, "\n";
      }
    }

    // Close handle
    curl_close($ch);
<?>

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    Information gathered by this function is kept if the handle is re-used.
    This means that unless a statistic is overridden internally by this
    function, the previous info is returned.
