sqlite_open

(PHP 5 < 5.4.0, PECL sqlite >= 1.0.0)

sqlite_open — Opens an SQLite database and create the database if it does not
exist

==============================================================================
*Description*

    resource sqlite_open ( string $filename [, int $mode = 0666 [, string~
    &$error_message ]] )~

Object oriented style (constructor):

final public SQLiteDatabase::__construct ( string $filename [, int $mode =
0666 [, string &$error_message ]] )

Opens an SQLite database or creates the database if it does not exist.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{filename}

    The filename of the SQLite database. If the file does not exist, SQLite
    will attempt to create it. PHP must have write permissions to the file if
    data is inserted, the database schema is modified or to create the
    database if it does not exist.

{mode}

    The mode of the file. Intended to be used to open the database in
    read-only mode. Presently, this parameter is ignored by the sqlite
    library. The default value for mode is the octal value 0666 and this is
    the recommended value.

{error_message}

    Passed by reference and is set to hold a descriptive error message
    explaining why the database could not be opened if there was an error.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns a resource (database handle) on success, FALSE on error.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 sqlite_open() example

<?php >
    if ($db = sqlite_open('mysqlitedb', 0666, $sqliteerror)) { 
        sqlite_query($db, 'CREATE TABLE foo (bar varchar(10))');
        sqlite_query($db, "INSERT INTO foo VALUES ('fnord')");
        $result = sqlite_query($db, 'select bar from foo');
        var_dump(sqlite_fetch_array($result)); 
    } else {
        die($sqliteerror);
    }
<?>

==============================================================================
*Notes*

Tip

On Unix platforms, SQLite is sensitive to scripts that use the fork() system
call. If you do have such a script, it is recommended that you close the
handle prior to forking and then re-open it in the child and/or parent. For
more information on this issue, see >> The C language interface to the SQLite
library in the section entitled Multi-Threading And SQLite.

Tip

It is not recommended to work with SQLite databases mounted on NFS partitions.
Since NFS is notoriously bad when it comes to locking you may find that you
cannot even open the database at all, and if it succeeds, the locking
behaviour may be undefined.

    Note: Starting with SQLite library version 2.8.2, you can specify :memory:
    as the {filename} to create a database that lives only in the memory of
    the computer. This is useful mostly for temporary processing, as the
    in-memory database will be destroyed when the process ends. It can also be
    useful when coupled with the ATTACH DATABASE SQL statement to load other
    databases and move and query data between them.

    Note: SQLite is safe mode and open_basedir aware.
